        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p14">Taking these excerpts together, we notice four things: (1) There was a housing slump—fewer houses being bought and sold, and house prices decreasing—in both the United Kingdom and the United States at around the same time. (2) Both are linked to a financial crisis. (3) These slumps affect other parts of the economy. (4) The housing problems lead to job losses.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p18">This excerpt tells us that the financial crisis has also affected other prices in the economies of the world. The price of equities—shares in companies—decreased, as did the price of goods such as basic minerals (copper and tin, for example) and basic foods (rice and coffee, for example). But even as these items became less valuable, the US dollar became more valuable. The price of the US dollar increased.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Agricultural Products Export Growth Slows Down in 2008</h3>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p20">China’s agricultural products exports rose 9.8 percent year-on-year in 2008 to $40.19 billion, the General Administration of Customs said on Wednesday.</p>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p21">According to the statistics, export growth declined 8.2 percentage points from a year earlier. Exports in the last two months of 2008 fell 6.9 percent and 7.2 percent to $3.47 billion and $3.76 billion respectively over the same period of 2007.</p>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p22">Although the country has increased export rebates for some agricultural products and lowered or even canceled the export tax, exports are unlikely to see a quick rebound in the near future. Poor overseas demand and falling prices in the international market amid the financial crisis, as well as the increasing distrust in China’s food quality are likely to stifle export growth, the General Administration of Customs said.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p24">The excerpt tells us that China’s exports of agricultural products have been growing rapidly, reaching a growth rate of nearly 10 percent in 2008. But they had been growing even faster in the previous year. The effects of the financial crisis and the economic downturn are clear: the amount of exports decreased at the end of 2008 (and in fact fell throughout 2009 as well).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p25">We have shown a few headlines about the impact of the 2008 financial crisis. We could have picked thousands of others. For example, if you enter into a search engine the terms <em class="emphasis">financial crisis</em> and <em class="emphasis">XYZ</em>, where XYZ is just about any product or international currency, you will probably find dozens, perhaps hundreds, of articles. The financial crisis of 2008 affected just about every market—all around the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p26">Our task in this chapter is certainly not to fully understand these events. Our goals here are much more modest. First, we want to develop the supply-and-demand framework—perhaps the most basic tool in economics—to understand how an event affecting some good or service leads to changes in the price of that good or service as well as changes in the quantity that is bought and sold. Second, we want to explore some of the ways in which different markets in the economy are linked, for linkages across markets are among the most important features of macroeconomic analysis. The financial crisis is a good illustration because this single event affected so many markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_p27">Understanding the sources and consequences of changing prices and quantities in the economy is one of the key tasks of an economist. There is an almost endless list of such analyses in economics. In fact, most of the applications in this textbook ultimately come down to understanding, explaining, and predicting changes in prices and quantities. The two questions that motivate this chapter are as follows:</p>

            <h3 class="title">Road Map</h3>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_s01_p01">The story of the crisis of 2008 is fascinating and worth understanding in some detail. We begin with the basics of supply and demand, looking at a single market—the market for houses. We explain how the equilibrium price and quantity in this market are determined, which allows us to understand why the price of housing changes. This is a first step to understanding the crisis of 2008 because the housing market was central to that story.</p>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_s01_p02">The story began in the housing market but did not end there. It spread across the economy and across the world. Hence we next look at three significant markets in the economy: the labor market, the credit market, and the foreign exchange market. Understanding how these three markets work is necessary for a good understanding of macroeconomics. We use these markets to provide more illustrations of supply and demand in action. Finally, we look at how markets are linked together to see how what might have seemed like a minor problem in one market turned into a cataclysmic event for the world’s economies.</p>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s00_s01_p03">Throughout this chapter, we use the term “the crisis of 2008” as shorthand, but the first signs of the crisis emerged well before that year, and the effects of the crisis are still being felt several years later. The crisis was a complex event, and right now, at the beginning of your studies of macroeconomics, we are not yet ready to delve deeply into a detailed analysis of those events. We return to the crisis in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch15#coopermacro-ch15">Chapter 15 "The Global Financial Crisis"</a>, which is a capstone chapter that brings together most of the tools of macroeconomics from this book.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_p06">The supply-and-demand framework applies to the case that economists call a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">competitive market</a><span class="glossdef">A market that satisfies two conditions: (1) there are many buyers and sellers, and (2) the goods the sellers produce are perfect substitutes.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_p50">As the price of housing decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This is an example of the law of demand, which derives from two effects:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>As the price of a good or service decreases, more individuals choose to buy a positive quantity rather than zero.</li>
            <li>As the price of a good or a service decreases, individuals choose to buy a larger quantity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_p02">In the case of the market for housing, the first of these is more important. Most people own either zero houses or one house. As houses become cheaper, more people decide that they can afford a house, so the quantity demanded increases. A few people might decide to buy an additional house, but they would presumably be in the rich minority. For other goods, such as chocolate bars or shoeshines, the second effect is more important: as price decreases, people increase the quantity that they buy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s03_p05">Economists typically believe that a perfectly competitive market is likely to reach equilibrium. The reasons for this belief are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s03_l02">
            <li>If price is different from the equilibrium price, then there will be an imbalance between demand and supply. This gives buyers and sellers an incentive to behave differently. For example, if price is less than the equilibrium price, demand will exceed supply. Disappointed buyers might start bidding up the price, or sellers might realize they could charge a higher price. The opposite is true if the price is too high: suppliers might be tempted to try cutting prices, while buyers might look for better deals.</li>
            <li>There is strong support for market predictions in the evidence from experimental markets. When buyers and sellers meet individually and bargain over prices, we typically see an outcome very similar to the market outcome in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s01_s03_f01">Figure 4.5 "Market Equilibrium"</a>.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The following is a typical account of the housing market crisis in 2008:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_p02">The immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the United States housing bubble which peaked in approximately 2005–2006. High default rates on “subprime” and adjustable rate mortgages (ARM), began to increase quickly thereafter. An increase in loan incentives such as easy initial terms and a long-term trend of rising housing prices had encouraged borrowers to assume difficult mortgages in the belief they would be able to quickly refinance at more favorable terms. […] However, once interest rates began to rise and housing prices started to drop moderately in 2006–2007 in many parts of the U.S., refinancing became more difficult. Defaults and foreclosure activity increased dramatically as easy initial terms expired, home prices failed to go up as anticipated, and ARM interest rates reset higher. Falling prices also resulted in 23% of U.S. homes worth less than the mortgage loan by September 2010, providing a financial incentive for borrowers to enter foreclosure.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn04_005">“Subprime Mortgage Crisis,” <em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, accessed June 28, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_p03">This quote identifies two forces that influenced the demand for housing in 2007–8. The first was expectations of future home prices. One of the gains from owning a house is the possibility that you can sell it at a higher price in the future. Prior to 2007, there had been a fairly consistent tendency for house prices to increase, but the quote seems to indicate that people began to doubt that this trend would continue. As a consequence, the demand for new homes decreased. The second force in the market for new housing was the availability of credit. Most households buy a new home by obtaining a loan (a mortgage) to cover some of the price of the house. During 2007 and 2008, it became increasingly difficult to obtain a mortgage. This was in contrast to a few years earlier when lending standards were easier, and many households easily qualified for mortgages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_p04">These forces affect market demand. The anticipation of lower home prices in the future implies that fewer individuals will choose to buy a home now. Further, if financing is more expensive, then less housing will be purchased. These effects operate <em class="emphasis">given</em> the current price of housing. That is, at any given current price of houses, a smaller quantity of houses is demanded. The market demand curve shifts leftward: at each given price, market demand is lower.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_p05">The shift in demand is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s02_s01_f01">Figure 4.6 "A Decrease in Demand for Housing"</a>. Once the demand curve shifts, the market for new houses is no longer in equilibrium. At the original price, there is now an imbalance between supply and demand: at that price, buyers want to purchase fewer homes than sellers wish to sell. To restore equilibrium in the market, there needs to be a reduction in housing prices and a reduction in the quantity of new houses produced. The decrease in production comes about because the lower price of houses makes suppliers less willing to produce houses for the market. The shift in the demand curve leads to a <em class="emphasis">movement along</em> the supply curve.</p>

A comparison of the old and new equilibrium points allows you to predict what will happen to equilibrium prices and quantities following an exogenous change.</p>

In this case, the units on the quantity axis are one-year $1,000 loans. The price on the vertical axis is the interest rate, which tells us the amount of the repayment per dollar loaned. The higher the repayment is, the more willing are banks to supply credit, so the supply curve slopes upward. The higher the repayment, the less willing are people to take out these loans, and so the demand curve slopes downward. If the repayment price were acceptable to you, you would “buy” one of these $1,000 loans. The equilibrium nominal interest rate is shown at the crossing of supply and demand.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s01_s01_p01">At the height of the financial crisis of 2008, credit became much more expensive—that is, interest rates increased. Why? As housing prices collapsed in the United States and elsewhere, a substantial number of mortgage loans became <em class="emphasis">nonperforming</em>. This means that borrowers were unable or unwilling to repay these loans and defaulted on them instead. In addition, because banks had sold and resold some of these mortgage loans, it was hard to identify which loans would be repaid and which would not. Some financial institutions that were holding a lot of bad loans went bankrupt, and others were in danger of going under as well.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s01_s01_p02">As a consequence, lenders became much more cautious about the types of loans they made—not only in mortgage markets but also throughout the economy. They were more careful about evaluating the likelihood that borrowers would repay their loans. This led to a reduction in the market supply of credit. The reduced supply of loans in the mortgage market was particularly acute. This appears as a leftward shift of the supply curve in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 4.8 "A Reduction in Supply in the Mortgage Market"</a>. Nominal interest rates increased, and the quantity of mortgages extended decreased. (The full story of what happened in credit markets is more complicated because central banks around the world also took actions to offset these changes and keep interest rates low.)</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s01_s02_p01">Mortgage rates and other interest rates are based on underlying dollar amounts; the interest rate tells you how many dollars borrowers must pay to lenders for each dollar that they borrow.

For example, suppose that the nominal interest rate is 5 percent, but inflation is also 5 percent. If you took out a $1,000 loan, you would have to pay back $1,050 next year.

Households borrow from banks to buy houses or cars. Households and firms make purchases using credit cards. Firms borrow from financial institutions to buy new equipment. The government borrows to finance its spending, and so on. There is a very large number of credit markets in the economy, each offering a different kind of credit, and each with its own equilibrium interest rate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s01_s03_p02">These different credit markets are linked because most households and firms buy or sell in more than one market.

The supply of credit increases as the interest rate increases. As the interest rate increases, other things being equal, households will generally save more and thus supply more to the credit market.

            <p class="para">Currencies are traded in foreign exchange markets, such as the market shown here in which dollars and euros are exchanged. The equilibrium exchange rate is the price where the quantity of euros supplied equals the quantity of euros demanded.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_p07">On the supply side, there are households and firms in Europe who want to buy US goods and services. To do so, they need to buy dollars and, therefore, must supply euros to the market. This supply of euros need not come only from European households and firms. Anyone holding euros is free to sell them in this market. On the demand side, there are households and firms who are holding dollars and who wish to buy European goods and services. They need to buy euros.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_p08">There is another source of the demand for and the supply of different currencies. Households and, more importantly, firms often hold assets denominated in different currencies. You could, if you wish, hold some of your wealth in Israeli government bonds, in shares of a South African firm, or in Argentine real estate. But to do so, you would need to buy Israeli shekels, South African rand, or Argentine pesos. Likewise, many foreign investors hold US assets, such as shares in Dell Inc. or debt issued by the US government. Thus the demand for and the supply of currencies are also influenced by the asset choices of households and firms. In practice, banks and other financial institutions conduct the vast majority of trades in foreign exchange markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_p09">As well as households and firms, monetary authorities also participate in foreign exchange markets. For example, the US Federal Reserve Bank monitors the value of the dollar and may even intervene in the market, buying or selling dollars in order to influence the exchange rate.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Foreign Exchange Markets in the 2008 Crisis</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p01">One of the articles we used to open this chapter dealt with changes in the value of the dollar in the fall of 2008. The article pointed out that the dollar was getting stronger relative to other currencies, such as the euro. This means that the price of a dollar in euros was increasing or, equivalently, the price of a euro in dollars was decreasing. In fact, the euro price of a dollar was about 0.67 in late September 2008; the price increased to nearly 0.81 by late October and then decreased again through December 2008.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p02">We can use the foreign exchange market to understand these events. <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.14 "Comparative Statics in the Euro Market"</a> shows the dollar market for euros once again. The increase in the value of the dollar discussed in the article is seen here as a rightward shift in the supply of euros, which decreases the value of the euro and—equivalently—increases the value of the dollar.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p03">There are two consequences of this shift in the supply curve. First, the shift in supply decreases the dollar price of the euro. So people in the United States who are planning to visit, say, France will find that they can obtain more euros for a given amount of dollars. Second, the quantity of euros actually bought and sold is higher. This is not inconsistent with the lower dollar price of a euro since the supply curve shifts along the demand curve for euros.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_s02_p01">We sometimes look at an individual exchange rate (e.g., dollar-euro) by thinking of the market where dollars are exchanged for euros. However, there are many different currencies that are exchanged for the US dollar. There are markets where dollars are exchanged for British pounds, Japanese yen, and so on. We can combine these into an aggregate foreign exchange market. Think of this as being the market where US dollars are bought with and sold for all the other currencies in the world. In this market, there is an aggregate exchange rate, which you can think of as an average of the exchange rates in all the individual markets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn04_012">More precisely, you should think of a weighted average. Because the United States trades much more with Canada than with, say, South Africa, movements in the US dollar–Canadian dollar exchange rate matter more than movements in the US dollar–South African rand exchange rate. <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch09#coopermacro-ch09">Chapter 9 "Money: A User’s Guide"</a> has more on exchange rates.</span> We show this market in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s03_s03_s02_f01">Figure 4.15 "Foreign Exchange Market Equilibrium"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_p02">In <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch04_s03#coopermacro-ch04_s03">Section 4.3 "Three Important Markets"</a>, we talked about the markets for credit, labor, and foreign exchange. We explained that we sometimes look at individual examples of these markets and sometimes at versions of these markets that apply to the economy as a whole.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_p03">But the story of the economic crisis in 2008 was not about a single market. Instead, what started as a problem in the US mortgage market was felt in the housing market in England, the labor market in China, the foreign exchange market in Europe, and many other markets. These different markets are connected; in this section, we explore these linkages. We do so through the <strong class="emphasis bold">circular flow of income</strong>, shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s04_f01">Figure 4.16 "The Circular Flow of Income"</a>. That model of the economy reveals the linkages across markets that the global financial crisis made so evident.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_p05">We know from the circular flow that the production of goods and services generates income in an economy. Some of that income is paid to the government in the form of taxes, but the rest finds its way to households. Much of the flow of dollars from firms to households takes place through the labor market because firms demand labor to produce goods. If firms are producing large quantities of goods and services, then they demand lots of labor, and income from the sale of labor services in the economy is high.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_p06">Some of the income that households earn from selling labor services is saved. There is therefore a link, through the household sector, between the labor market and the credit market. So we can follow a connection from the production of goods and services to the supply of credit: if firms produce more, they generate more labor income, so there is more saving supplied by households to the credit market. There is also a link from the markets for goods and services to the <em class="emphasis">demand</em> for credit: firms borrow to purchase investment goods.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_p07">These markets are also linked—directly or indirectly—to foreign exchange markets. Whenever firms purchase imported goods, such as oil, this generates a demand for foreign exchange. When firms expand output, demand more labor, and so generate additional household income, households spend some of this income on imports, again generating a demand for foreign exchange. When households and firms in other countries want to buy our goods and services, that generates a supply of foreign exchange. And many transactions in credit markets also generate a demand for or supply of foreign exchange.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Comparative Statics in an Interconnected World</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_p01">We could go on, but the point should be clear: the markets in every economy are intimately interconnected. This has a critical implication for our study of macroeconomics, which is that it both complicates and enriches our comparative static analyses. When a shift in supply or demand in one market affects the equilibrium price and quantity in that market, there are changes in other markets as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn04_013">There is a second, more abstract implication: we have to worry about whether <em class="emphasis">all the markets in the economy are in equilibrium at the same time</em>. In our analyses, we have looked at only one market at a time. But we now know that the outcome in one market (for example, the real wage) can affect supply and demand in other markets (for example, the supply of credit). In advanced studies in economics, we use complicated mathematics to see if there are prices that are consistent with all the markets being in equilibrium at once. The bottom line is good news: we can usually be confident that there is an equilibrium for all markets. But because this is such an advanced area of economics, we do not worry about it further in this book.</span> In this section, we show how these interactions across markets help us understand the propagation of the 2008 crisis from the US housing market to the economies of the world. We have already hinted at some of these linkages, but now we make them more explicit.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s01_p01">The story began with the first comparative static example that we looked at: a leftward shift in demand for housing. Potential buyers of houses started worrying that the <em class="emphasis">future</em> price of houses would decrease. This made people more reluctant to buy houses. Meanwhile, a tightening of lending standards made it harder for people to obtain loans. Both of these caused the demand for housing to shift leftward. Part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s01_f01">Figure 4.17</a>, which we already saw earlier in the chapter, shows us that this led to a decrease in both the price and the quantity of houses.</p>

                <p class="para">A decrease in demand for housing led to a decrease in supply of credit. (a) Worsening expectations about <em class="emphasis">future</em> house prices, together with tighter lending conditions, led to a decrease in demand for housing. (b) In the credit market, banks and other lending institutions found themselves with bad debt, so the supply of credit decreased.</p>

The decrease in housing prices, combined with the complicated way in which mortgages had been sold and resold by financial institutions, meant that many financial institutions found themselves in trouble. Some went bankrupt. This made financial institutions cautious about lending to each other, so the supply of credit shifted to the left. Interest rates rose. (Interest rates in the crisis were also affected by the actions of the US Federal Reserve and other monetary authorities around the world.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn04_014">We discuss such policies in detail when we return to the crisis in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch15#coopermacro-ch15">Chapter 15 "The Global Financial Crisis"</a>.</span>)</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s02_p01">If you run a business, you often have to rely on credit (loans) to finance the purchase of your inputs into the production process. For example, suppose you run a boutique clothing store. You have to buy the clothes to put on display first, and you get your revenues only when you sell the clothes. Weeks or even months may pass between the time you incur your costs and the time you get your revenues. Unless you have the funds available to buy all your stock up front, you will need to borrow. The same is true in many other businesses. Firms regularly take out short-term loans to pay for some of their costs of operation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s02_p02">When interest rates increase, businesses see their costs increase. Higher costs make it less profitable to produce at any given price, so most businesses cut back on their production. Some may even leave the market altogether. As a consequence, the supply curve for most goods and services shifts leftward, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s02_f01">Figure 4.18</a>. We see that the equilibrium price increases, and the equilibrium quantity decreases. Going back to an individual producer, what does this mean? The producer sees costs increase. In the new equilibrium, the producer also obtains a higher price. However, the increase in price is not as big as the increase in cost.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Trade Flows and a Shift in the Demand for Foreign Exchange</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p01">One of the excerpts we used to introduce this chapter touched on the effects of the crisis on exports from China. We now broaden our discussion to include those effects as well. Looking back at <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s03_f01">Figure 4.19 "A Decrease in Demand for Labor"</a>, recall that part of household spending goes toward the purchase of goods and services produced in other countries. A significant fraction of imports to the United States come from China. China also sells goods and services to Japan, Europe, and most of the world.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p02">When demand from these economies slumps, as it did in 2008, exports from China also decrease. Since exports are a part of overall spending, this leads firms in China to cut back their production and employment. Thus the Chinese economy was also slowed down by the effects of the financial crisis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p03">The reduced demand for imports has another effect. Because the demand for foreign currency is partly motivated by the desire to buy goods from that country, a decrease in the import of Chinese goods to the United States and other countries leads to a decrease in demand for the Chinese yuan. There is a leftward shift in the demand for that currency and thus a lower price in dollars. (As with all comparative static exercises, this assumes that nothing else is changing to offset these effects on the demand for the yuan.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p04">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">current account balance</a><span class="glossdef">The difference between the value of exports and imports of goods and services plus net income from foreign assets.</span></span> is (roughly speaking) the difference between the value of exports and imports of goods and services. A country has a current account surplus if the value of exports of goods and services exceeds the value of its imports. A country has a current account deficit if the value of imports of goods and services exceeds the value of its exports. Looking at the United States and China, one sees very different behavior for the current account.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn04_016">This discussion draws on data from the International Monetary Fund. See Stephan Danninger and Florence Jaumotte, “Divergence of Current Account Balances across Emerging Economies,” World Economic Outlook, Chapter 6, accessed June 28, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/pdf/c6.pdf">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/pdf/c6.pdf</a>.</span> In recent years, the United States has run a current account deficit of nearly 5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). China, in contrast, has run a current account surplus of about 6.1 percent of its GDP since 2002.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p05">The reduced demand for imports from China has an effect on the current account balance of China. We would expect to see a reduction in the current account surplus of China due to the reduction in economic activity of its trading partners.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p06">You might also wonder how the persistent deficits of the United States are paid for. When a country runs a current account deficit, it is borrowing from other countries. This is just like a household that pays for consumption above its income by means of borrowing. The rules of national income accounting tell us that the flows in and out of each sector must always be in balance. If we look at the flows in and out of the foreign sector we see that</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">borrowing from abroad = imports − exports</span></span>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">or</span></span>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">lending to abroad = exports − imports.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p07"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Net exports</a><span class="glossdef">Exports minus imports.</span></span> (sometimes called the trade surplus) equal exports minus imports. So lending to other countries equals net exports.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p08">The circular flow of income tells us something powerful: whenever we import more than we export, we <em class="emphasis">must</em>, on net, be borrowing from abroad. On reflection, this is not so surprising. Other countries are giving us more goods and services than we are giving to them. This is not done out of generosity; they do so because they expect to be repaid at some point in the future. If we export more than we import, then this flow goes in the other direction, and we are lending to abroad.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s01_s05_p09">Both China and the United States trade with many other countries, so this pattern of trade holds true bilaterally (that is, between them) as well. China has run systematic current account surpluses with the United States, meaning that China is lending to the United States. Those loans take many forms, with commentators highlighting Chinese purchases of US government debt. US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton alluded to this connection between the two economies during a visit to China in early 2009.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Crisis of 2008: A Brief Summary</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s02_p01">The crisis began with a reduction in the demand for houses and a consequent decrease in the value of houses. This reduced the value of assets, particularly mortgage-backed securities, and meant that the supply of credit in the economy shifted inward. The consequence was higher interest rates and reduced credit. Since many firms in the economy borrow to finance production, the increased interest rates increased their marginal costs of production. Supply curves throughout the economy shifted inward, leading to lower output. Firms needed fewer workers, so there was a reduction in employment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s02_p02">The spread to other countries came through a couple of avenues. First, households and firms in other countries were one source of credit to the US economy. When asset prices decreased, the portfolios of foreign banks were also adversely affected. This led to higher interest rates and lower output in those countries. In addition, as the US economy went into recession, it purchased fewer imports from other countries. This led to lower production in those countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s02_p03">Our description of the crisis is of necessity a simple one. We have neglected many details, and we have not discussed how government policies also affected interest rates and the demand for goods and services. Later chapters in the book provide more tools for understanding these aspects of the crisis, so when we return to the topic in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch15#coopermacro-ch15">Chapter 15 "The Global Financial Crisis"</a>, we can provide a more complete analysis of the crisis.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="coopermacro-ch04_s04_s02_l01">
                <li>Markets are linked because supply and demand in one market generally depend on the outcomes in other markets. The circular flow of income illustrates some of these connections across markets.</li>
                <li>Although the crisis in 2008 may have started in the housing market, it did not end there. Instead, the crisis impacted markets for labor, credit, and foreign exchange.</li>

                <li>We have explained that increases in interest rates shift the supply of goods leftward, and decreases in incomes shift the demand for goods leftward. Draw diagrams with both shifts at once and show that the quantity definitely decreases, but the price may increase or decrease.</li>
                <li>Can you think of a good for which the demand curve might shift rightward when incomes decrease?</li>

        <h3 class="title">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s05_p01">The supply-and-demand framework is almost certainly the most powerful model in the economist’s toolkit. Armed with an understanding of this framework, you can make sense of much economic news, and you can make intelligent predictions about future changes in prices.</p>
        <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s05_p02">A true understanding of this framework is more than just an ability to shift curves around, however. It is an understanding of how markets and prices are one of the main ways in which the world is interlinked. Markets are, quite simply, at the heart of economic life. Markets are the means by which suppliers and demanders of goods and services can meet and exchange their wares. Since exchange creates value—because it makes both buyers and sellers better off—markets are the means by which our economy can prosper. Markets are the means by which economic activity is coordinated in our economy, allowing us to specialize in what we do best and to buy other goods and services.</p>
        <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch04_s05_p03">Economists regularly point to these features of markets, but this should not blind us to the fact that markets can go wrong. There are many ways in which market outcomes may not be the most desirable or efficient, as the global financial crisis revealed. In the remainder of this book, we look in considerable detail at all the ways that markets can fail us as well as help us.</p>
