    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_p03">We start with the market for new homes, which are part of real gross domestic product (real GDP). (The buying and selling of existing homes is not counted in GDP.) New homes are supplied by construction firms and demanded by families wishing to live in a new home. New homes are also bought by speculators who purchase houses in the hope that they can resell them for a higher price in the future.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_p06">The supply-and-demand framework applies to the case that economists call a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">competitive market</a><span class="glossdef">A market that satisfies two conditions: (1) there are many buyers and sellers, and (2) the goods the sellers produce are perfect substitutes.</span></span>. A market is said to be competitive, or, more precisely, to exhibit perfect competition, under two conditions:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_l02">
        <li>There are many buyers and many sellers, all of whom are small relative to the market.</li>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_p07">In a competitive market, buyers and sellers take the price as given; they think their actions have no effect on the price in the market.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_p01">The market demand for housing is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "The Market Demand for Houses"</a>. We call this the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market demand curve</a><span class="glossdef">The number of units of a good or a service demanded at each price.</span></span> because it reflects the choices of the many households in the economy. In macroeconomics, we typically look at markets at this level of aggregation and do not worry much about the individual decisions that underlie curves such as this one.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_p50">As the price of housing decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This is an example of the law of demand, which derives from two effects:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>As the price of a good or service decreases, more individuals choose to buy a positive quantity rather than zero.</li>
            <li>As the price of a good or a service decreases, individuals choose to buy a larger quantity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s01_p02">In the case of the market for housing, the first of these is more important. Most people own either zero houses or one house. As houses become cheaper, more people decide that they can afford a house, so the quantity demanded increases. A few people might decide to buy an additional house, but they would presumably be in the rich minority. For other goods, such as chocolate bars or shoeshines, the second effect is more important: as price decreases, people increase the quantity that they buy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s03_p05">Economists typically believe that a perfectly competitive market is likely to reach equilibrium. The reasons for this belief are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch04_s01_s03_l02">
            <li>If price is different from the equilibrium price, then there will be an imbalance between demand and supply. This gives buyers and sellers an incentive to behave differently. For example, if price is less than the equilibrium price, demand will exceed supply. Disappointed buyers might start bidding up the price, or sellers might realize they could charge a higher price. The opposite is true if the price is too high: suppliers might be tempted to try cutting prices, while buyers might look for better deals.</li>
            <li>There is strong support for market predictions in the evidence from experimental markets. When buyers and sellers meet individually and bargain over prices, we typically see an outcome very similar to the market outcome in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch04_s01_s03_f01">Figure 4.5 "Market Equilibrium"</a>.</li>
            <li>The supply-and-demand framework generally provides reliable predictions about the movement of prices.</li>

Keep in mind, however, that firms and households in the market do not need any of this information. This is one of the beauties of the market. All an individual firm or household needs to know is the prevailing market price. All the coordination occurs through the workings of the market.</p>
