In this section, we develop such a theory and then use it to look again at the question of convergence.

(Of course, output per worker and output per person are very closely related. For the US economy, the workforce is roughly half the total population, so output per person is therefore approximately half as much as output per worker.) The growth rate of output per worker equals the growth rate of output minus the growth rate of the workforce:</p>

Invention, innovation, education, training, and improvements in social infrastructure are the drivers of economic growth in the very long run.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s02_p03">Perhaps surprisingly, the growth rate of the capital stock is not a fundamental determinant of the growth rate. When we have balanced growth, the capital stock grows, which contributes to the overall growth of output. But if we ask what determines the overall growth rate in an economy, it is the growth of technology and human capital. The capital stock then adjusts to keep the economy on its balanced-growth path. By the definition of balanced growth, the growth rate of the capital stock is equal to the output growth rate.</p>

Look first at output. Notice that even though the <em class="emphasis">growth rate</em> of output is constant, the graph is not a straight line. Instead, it curves upward: the change in the <em class="emphasis">level</em> of output increases over time. This is because a growth rate is a percentage change. In our example, output in 2000 is $10 trillion, and the growth rate is 3 percent. From 2000 to 2001, output increases by $300 billion (= $10 trillion × 0.03). By 2050, output is equal to $44 trillion. Between that year and the next, output increases by $1.3 trillion (= $44 trillion × 0.03). Even though the growth rate is the same, the change in the level of output is more than four times as large.</p>

If a country has a small capital stock relative to GDP, then its capital stock will grow faster than real GDP. Countries that are still developing may well be in this position.

Like the economy in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch06_s04_s02_f01">Figure 6.13 "Output and Capital Stock in a Balanced-Growth Economy"</a>, the balanced-growth output growth rate is 3 percent. The workforce grows at 1 percent, so output per worker grows at 2 percent along the balanced-growth path. However, this economy starts off (in the year 2000) with a smaller capital stock than is needed for balanced growth. Looking at the first row of the table, you can see that the capital stock grows at 14.4 percent, while output grows at 6.8 percent. Because capital grows faster than output, there is an additional component to growth, as we have just explained. This contributes an extra 3.8 percentage points to the growth rate, so output per worker grows at 5.8 percent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s03_p05">As time goes on, the capital stock grows relative to output, and the economy gets closer to the balanced-growth path. As this happens, the additional component of growth becomes smaller. For example, in 2010, the capital stock grows at 6.8 percent, and output grows at 4.3 percent. The growth rate of output per worker is 3.3 percent—2 percentage points being the balanced-growth contribution and 1.3 percent due to the faster growth rate of capital stock compared to output. By 2050, the economy is close to balanced growth: output per worker grows at 2.3 percent, with capital stock growing only a little bit faster than output.</p>

They both have the same levels of technology and human capital and the same balanced-growth ratio of capital stock to GDP. However, they have different amounts of physical capital. Suppose that one of the countries has a large capital stock (call it the rich country) and the other country has a much smaller capital stock (call it the poor country).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s01_p02">These two economies will initially have different levels of output and living standards. Our model predicts, however, that these differences will be temporary. Both economies will approach the balanced-growth path. The poor country will grow more rapidly because its ratio of capital stock to GDP will be increasing more quickly as it moves toward the balanced-growth path. Over time, we expect to see the poor country catch up to the rich one. We illustrate this in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s01_f01">Figure 6.15 "Convergence of a Rich Country and a Poor Country"</a>.</p>

                <p class="para">Consider two economies, identical in all respects except that one has a smaller capital stock than the other. The poorer country accumulates capital faster than the richer country and grows faster.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s01_p03">This is exactly the same mechanism for convergence that we saw before. The country with a smaller capital stock will have a higher marginal product of capital and will grow faster because the country is a more attractive place for investment. Because the poor country accumulates capital more rapidly than the richer country, it will grow faster. The two countries will converge to the same balanced-growth path and to the same level of output per person.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Convergence in Human Capital</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s02_p01">So far we have not considered why human capital might change over time. If there are reasons to think that this variable might grow more quickly in poor countries than in rich countries, we have another force that might drive convergence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s02_p02">In some ways, human capital resembles physical capital. As with the physical capital stock, some accumulation is the result of decisions by governments, and some comes from decisions by private agents. From the government side, it is likely that economies with low levels of human capital might also be economies in which there is a high return to basic education. If literacy rates are low and most children do not receive much education, even straightforward investments in schooling might yield big gains in terms of the ultimate capabilities of the workforce. Governments in poor countries might see big potential gains from investment in education. Private individuals and firms may also perceive that the returns on education are larger in poorer economies. If very few people in the economy have college degrees, an individual might find that a college education yields a very large payoff. By contrast, if the population as a whole is highly educated, it might take a much larger investment to stand out from others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s02_p03">This discussion is somewhat speculative. Human capital is difficult to measure, and the marginal product of human capital is even harder to quantify. Nevertheless, there are some good reasons to believe that the incentives to invest in human capital are greater in poorer economies. If so, we have another reason to expect convergence.</p>

        <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Convergence in Technology</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s03_p01">What about technology? Will it grow faster in poorer economies? The answer depends on which aspect of technology we are talking about.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s03_p02">Differences in knowledge between rich and poor countries are likely to diminish over time. Rich economies are typically close to the technology frontier, meaning that they are using state-of-the-art production techniques. For countries on the technology frontier, growth in knowledge can only come the hard way, through investment in research and development (R&amp;D). Countries inside the technology frontier are typically poorer developing countries. These economies can grow their stock of knowledge simply by importing knowledge from countries at the frontier. Technological advance is much cheaper and easier if you can use others’ inventions and innovations rather than coming up with your own. We therefore expect such countries to have faster growth rates of knowledge. As they become more developed, the growth of knowledge in these economies will slow down to the rate experienced by other countries near the technology frontier. But in the meantime, they will grow faster than rich countries. Technology transfer to developing economies is surely a force leading to convergence of economies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s04_s03_p03">There is less to say about social infrastructure and natural resources. The amount of natural resources available in an economy is largely due to accidents of history and geography: there is no obvious reason to expect the growth rate of natural resources to be linked to the level of development. Social infrastructure, meanwhile, is a complicated mix of institutions, customs, and other factors. Again, there is no obvious reason to expect social infrastructure to grow more quickly in poorer economies.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Divergence Revisited</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p01">Now that we have incorporated human capital and technology into our framework, we can identify some further possible explanations of divergence. Our theory says that economies will converge if they differ only in terms of their initial capital stock. But it is possible that different economies will also have different balanced-growth paths. <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_f01">Figure 6.16 "Balanced Growth in Two Countries with Different Ratios of Capital to Output"</a> shows what this looks like. The ratio of capital stock to output in the very long run depends on a number of different factors, including the growth rate of technology and the growth rate of the workforce. If these differ across countries, then their balanced-growth paths will differ as well, and we will not observe convergence.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn06_021">The toolkit presents a complete model of balanced growth, including a formula for the balanced-growth ratio of capital stock to output.</span></p>
        <div class="figure large large-height editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 6.16</span> Balanced Growth in Two Countries with Different Ratios of Capital to Output</p>

            <p class="para">Economies may have different balanced-growth paths. In this example, the ratio of capital stock to output is higher in country A than in country B.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p02">This explanation—and our previous stories of divergence—tells us why different economies will not necessarily end up at exactly the same level of output per worker. But the problem of divergence is in some ways worse than that. Some countries are not only failing to converge but also moving further and further apart. In other words, in some cases, richer economies are growing faster than poorer economies. Indeed, as we saw with Niger, some of the poorest economies in the world have been shrinking rather than growing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p03">Remember that the growth rate of output per worker on a balanced-growth path is as follows:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="coopermacro-06_m007" display="block"><semantics><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>balanced-growth output-per-worker growth rate</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mo>=</mo><mtext>human capital growth rate</mtext><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>×</mo><mtext>technology growth rate</mtext><mtext>.</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p04">We can explain divergence in our framework if human capital or technology is growing more slowly in poor countries than in rich ones. Are there reasons to expect this to be the case? Earlier, we said that countries with low levels of human capital might also be countries where the return to human capital investment was large, which is a force for convergence. We also pointed out, however, that the marginal product of physical capital might be larger in an economy with a superior technology, even if that economy had more capital. The same is true of human capital. Countries can build up their human capital through schooling and training. They can also build up their human capital by attracting skilled workers from other countries. If richer countries are able to attract skilled workers, then we will see divergence rather than convergence.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn06_022">In <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch05#coopermacro-ch05">Chapter 5 "Globalization and Competitiveness"</a>, we discuss how economies actively seek to attract human capital.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p05">Turning to technology, divergence in social infrastructure is certainly a possibility. Social infrastructure includes the rule of law, the general business climate, social attitudes toward corruption, the protection of property rights, and many other intangible factors. These influences on economic growth are difficult to define and almost impossible to measure accurately. Yet economists are convinced that successful economies must have a good set of such social institutions. It is likely that it is easier to build and improve such institutions in countries that are relatively prosperous, which would again lead richer countries to grow more rapidly than poorer countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p06">Economists have built some of these ideas into the theoretical framework of economic growth. Unfortunately, the models are too complicated for an introductory economics textbook, so we will not go into them in any detail here. We can, however, provide a simple example that conveys the flavor of these more complex ideas. The story goes as follows. We know that workers acquire human capital through education and on-the-job training. Suppose that, when there is more <em class="emphasis">physical</em> capital in the economy (relative to the number of workers), it is easier to acquire <em class="emphasis">human</em> capital. You can study in modern facilities with up-to-date computers. You work with state-of-the-art machinery and become more skilled. In this story, human capital is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">endogenous</a><span class="glossdef">Something that is explained within our analysis.</span></span>: it depends on the amount of physical capital.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p07">To be concrete, imagine that technology is constant, and the amount of human capital is proportional to the amount of physical capital per worker. When we incorporate this assumption into the production function, we end up with a very straightforward relationship:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">output = <em class="emphasis">B</em> × physical capital,</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p08">where <em class="emphasis">B</em> is just a number.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn06_023">The derivation of this equation is not very difficult; it is explained in the toolkit.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p09">In this economy, the ratio of capital stock to GDP is constant at all times (capital/output = 1/<em class="emphasis">B</em>). This economy is <em class="emphasis">always</em> on a balanced-growth path. Because of this, the growth rate of output equals the growth rate of capital stock:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">output growth rate = physical capital growth rate.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p10">The more important point, though, is that this technology <em class="emphasis">does not exhibit diminishing marginal product of capital</em>. The marginal product of capital is constant: it equals <em class="emphasis">B</em>. If this number were different in different economies, then we would expect to see capital stock flowing from economies where <em class="emphasis">B</em> is small toward economies where <em class="emphasis">B</em> is large. We would see divergence rather than convergence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch06_s04_s05_p11">The model that we have described in this subsection is simplistic. Its point is simply to show that, if we make human capital endogenous, it is much easier to explain divergence. Economists have built more complicated and realistic models with endogenous human capital and technology that give similar results.</p>
