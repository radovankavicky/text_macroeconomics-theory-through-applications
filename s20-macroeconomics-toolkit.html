    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_l01">
        <li>Because these tools appear in multiple chapters, the toolkit serves as a reference. When using a tool in one chapter, you can refer back to the toolkit to find a more concise description of the tool as well as links to other parts of the book where the tool is used.</li>
        <li>You can use the toolkit as a study guide. Once you have worked through the material in the chapters, you can review the tools using this toolkit.</li>

<span class="title-prefix">16.1</span> The Labor Market</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s01_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">labor market</strong> is the market in which labor services are traded. <em class="emphasis">Individual labor supply</em> comes from the choices of individuals or households about how to allocate their time. As the <strong class="emphasis bold">real wage</strong> (the nominal wage divided by the price level) increases, households supply more hours to the market, and more households decide to participate in the labor market. Thus the quantity of labor supplied increases. The labor supply curve of a household is shifted by changes in wealth. A wealthier household supplies less labor at a given real wage.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">Labor demand</em> comes from firms. As the real wage increases, the marginal cost of hiring more labor increases, so each firm demands fewer hours of labor input—that is, a firm’s labor demand curve is downward sloping. The labor demand curve of a firm is shifted by changes in productivity. If labor becomes more productive, then the labor demand curve of a firm shifts rightward: the quantity of labor demanded is higher at a given real wage.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s01_p03">The labor market equilibrium is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s01_f01">Figure 16.1 "Labor Market Equilibrium"</a>. The real wage and the equilibrium quantity of labor traded are determined by the intersection of labor supply and labor demand. At the equilibrium real wage, the quantity of labor supplied equals the quantity of labor demanded.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.2</span> Choices over Time</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s02_p01">Individuals make decisions that unfold over time. Because individuals choose how to spend income earned over many periods on consumption goods over many periods, they sometimes wish to save or borrow rather than spend all their income in every period.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s02_p02"><a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s02_s01_f01">Figure 16.2 "Choices over Time"</a> shows examples of these choices over a two-year horizon. The individual earns income this year and next. The combinations of consumption that are affordable and that exhaust all of an individual’s income are shown on the budget line, which in this case is called an intertemporal budget constraint. The slope of the budget line is equal to (1 + real interest rate), which is equivalent to the <em class="emphasis">real interest factor</em>. The slope is the amount of consumption that can be obtained tomorrow by giving up a unit of consumption today.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s02_p03">The preferred point is also indicated; it is the combination of consumption this year and consumption next year that the individual prefers to all the points on the budget line. The individual in part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s02_s01_f01">Figure 16.2 "Choices over Time"</a> is consuming less this year than she is earning: she is saving. Next year she can use her savings to consume more than her income. The individual in part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s02_s01_f01">Figure 16.2 "Choices over Time"</a> is consuming more this year than he is earning: he is borrowing. Next year, his consumption will be less than his income because he must repay the amount borrowed this year.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s02_p04">When the real interest rate increases, individuals will borrow less and (usually) save more (the effect of interest rate changes on saving is unclear as a matter of theory because <strong class="emphasis bold">income effects</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">substitution effects</strong> act in opposite directions). Thus <strong class="emphasis bold">individual loan supply</strong> slopes upward.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s02_p05">Of course, individuals live for many periods and make frequent decisions on consumption and saving. The <strong class="emphasis bold">lifetime budget constraint</strong> is obtained using the idea of <strong class="emphasis bold">discounted present value</strong>:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">discounted present value of lifetime income = discounted present value of lifetime consumption.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s02_p06">The left side is a measure of all the <strong class="emphasis bold">disposable income</strong> the individual will receive over his lifetime (disposable means after taking into account taxes paid to the government and transfers received from the government). The right side calculates the value of consumption of all goods and services over an individual’s lifetime.</p>

    <p class="para block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s03_p06">If an asset (such as a bond) yields a payment next year of $10 and has a price next year of $90, then the “flow benefit from asset + price of the asset next year” is $100.

<span class="title-prefix">16.4</span> The Credit (Loan) Market (Macro)</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p01">Consider a simple example of a loan. Imagine you go to your bank to inquire about a loan of $1,000, to be repaid in one year’s time. A loan is a contract that specifies three things:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_l01">
        <li>The amount being borrowed (in this example, $1,000)</li>
        <li>The date(s) at which repayment must be made (in this example, one year from now)</li>
        <li>The amount that must be repaid</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p02">What determines the amount of the repayment? The lender—the bank—is a supplier of credit, and the borrower—you—is a demander of credit. We use the terms <em class="emphasis">credit</em> and <em class="emphasis">loans</em> interchangeably. The higher the repayment amount, the more attractive this loan contract will look to the bank. Conversely, the lower the repayment amount, the more attractive this contract is to you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p03">If there are lots of banks that are willing to supply such loans, and lots of people like you who demand such loans, then we can draw supply and demand curves in the credit (loan) market. The equilibrium price of this loan is the interest rate at which supply equals demand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p04">In macroeconomics, we look at not only individual markets like this but also the credit (loan) market for an entire economy. This market brings together suppliers of loans, such as households that are saving, and demanders of loans, such as businesses and households that need to borrow. The <strong class="emphasis bold">real interest rate</strong> is the “price” that brings demand and supply into balance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p05">The supply of loans in the domestic loans market comes from three different sources:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_l02">
        <li>The private saving of households and firms</li>
        <li>The saving of governments (in the case of a government surplus)</li>
        <li>The saving of foreigners (when there is a flow of capital into the domestic economy)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p06">Households will generally respond to an increase in the real interest rate by reducing current consumption relative to future consumption. Households that are saving will save more; households that are borrowing will borrow less. Higher interest rates also encourage foreigners to send funds to the domestic economy. Government saving or borrowing is little affected by interest rates.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p07">The demand for loans comes from three different sources:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_l03">
        <li>The borrowing of households and firms to finance purchases, such as housing, durable goods, and investment goods</li>
        <li>The borrowing of governments (in the case of a government deficit)</li>
        <li>The borrowing of foreigners (when there is a flow of capital from the domestic economy)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p08">As the real interest rate increases, investment and durable goods spending decrease. For firms, a high interest rate represents a high cost of funding investment expenditures. This is an application of discounted present value and is evident if a firm borrows to purchase capital. It is also true if it uses internal funds (retained earnings) to finance investment because the firm could always put those funds into an interest-bearing asset instead. For households, higher interest rates likewise make it more costly to borrow to purchase housing and durable goods. The demand for credit decreases as the interest rate rises. When it is expensive to borrow, households and firms will borrow less.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s04_p09">Equilibrium in the market for loans is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s04_s02_f01">Figure 16.3 "The Credit Market"</a>. On the horizontal axis is the total quantity of loans in equilibrium. The demand curve for loans is downward sloping, whereas the supply curve has a positive slope. Loan market equilibrium occurs at the real interest rate where the quantity of loans supplied equals the quantity of loans demanded. At this equilibrium real interest rate, lenders lend as much as they wish, and borrowers can borrow as much as they wish. Equilibrium in the aggregate credit market is what ensures the balance of flows into and out of the financial sector in the circular flow diagram.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s05_p01">If you have some data expressed in nominal terms (for example, in dollars), and you want to convert them to real terms, you should use the following four steps.</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s05_l01">
        <li>Select your deflator. In most cases, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the best deflator to use. You can find data on the CPI (for the United States) at the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov">http://www.bls.gov</a>).</li>
        <li>Select your base year. Find the value of the index in that base year.</li>
        <li>For all years (including the base year), divide the value of the index in that year by the value in the base year. The value for the base year is 1.</li>
        <li>For each year, divide the value in the nominal data series by the number you calculated in step 3. This gives you the value in “base year dollars.”</li>

We have data on the CPI for three years, as listed in the second column. The price index is created using the year 2000 as a base year, following steps 1–3. Sales measured in millions of dollars are given in the fourth column. To correct for inflation, we divide sales in each year by the value of the price index for that year. The results are shown in the fifth column. Because there was inflation each year (the price index is increasing over time), real sales do not increase as rapidly as nominal sales.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s05_p04">To construct a price index, you must choose a fixed basket of goods. For example, we could use the goods purchased in 2013 (12 T-shirts, 60 downloads, and 5 meals). This fixed basket is then priced in different years. To construct the cost of the 2013 basket at 2013 prices, the product of the price and the quantity purchased for each good in 2013 is added together. The basket costs $442. Then we calculate the cost of the 2013 basket at 2012 prices: that is, we use the prices of each good in 2012 and the quantities purchased in 2013. The sum is $425. The price index is constructed using 2012 as a base year. The value of the price index for 2013 is the cost of the basket in 2013 divided by its cost in the base year (2012).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s05_p05">When the price index is based on a bundle of goods that represents total output in an economy, it is called the <strong class="emphasis bold">price level</strong>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s06_p03">Marginal cost usually increases as a firm produces more output. Thus an increase in the price of a product creates an incentive for firms to produce more—that is, the supply curve of a firm is upward sloping.

Trade is at the heart of modern economies: individuals specialize in production and generalize in consumption.

To produce an extra kilogram of tomatoes in Guatemala, 6 hours of labor time must be taken away from beer production; 6 hours of labor time is the equivalent of 2 liters of beer. In Mexico, the opportunity cost of 1 kilogram of tomatoes is 1 liter of beer. Thus the opportunity cost of producing tomatoes is lower in Mexico than in Guatemala. This means that Mexico has a comparative advantage in the production of tomatoes. By a similar logic, Guatemala has a comparative advantage in the production of beer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s07_p04">Guatemala and Mexico can have higher levels of consumption of both beer and tomatoes if they trade rather than produce in isolation; each country should specialize (either partially or completely) in the good in which it has a comparative advantage.

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_p03">Foreign currencies are supplied by foreign households, firms, and governments that wish to purchase goods, services, or financial assets denominated in the domestic currency. For example, if a Canadian bank wants to buy a US government bond, the bank must sell Canadian dollars. As the price of a foreign currency increases, the quantity supplied of that currency increases.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_p04">Exchange rates are determined just like other prices—by the interaction of supply and demand. At the equilibrium exchange rate, the supply and demand for a currency are equal. Shifts in the supply or the demand for a currency lead to changes in the exchange rate. Because one currency is exchanged for another in a foreign exchange market, the demand for one currency entails the supply of another. Thus the dollar market for euros (where the price is dollars per euro and the quantity is euros) is the mirror image of the euro market for dollars (where the price is euros per dollar and the quantity is dollars).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_p05">To be concrete, consider the demand for and the supply of euros. The supply of euros comes from the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_l01">
        <li>European households and firms that wish to buy goods and services from countries that do not have the euro as their currency</li>
        <li>European investors who wish to buy assets (government debt, stocks, bonds, etc.) that are denominated in currencies other than the euro</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_p06">The demand for euros comes from the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_l02">

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_p08">The foreign exchange market can be used as a basis for comparative statics exercises. We can study how changes in an economy affect the exchange rate. For example, suppose there is an increase in the level of economic activity in the United States. This leads to an increase in the demand for European goods and services. To make these purchases, US households and firms will demand more euros. This causes an outward shift in the demand curve and an increase in the dollar price of euros.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s10_p09">When the dollar price of a euro increases, we say that the dollar has depreciated relative to the euro. From the perspective of the euro, the depreciation of the dollar represents an appreciation of the euro.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.11</span> Growth Rates</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_p01">If some variable <em class="emphasis">x</em> (for example, the number of gallons of gasoline sold in a week) changes from <em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, then we can define the change in that variable as Δ<em class="emphasis">x</em> = <em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> − <em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. But there are difficulties with this simple definition. The number that we calculate will change, depending on the units in which we measure <em class="emphasis">x</em>. If we measure in millions of gallons, <em class="emphasis">x</em> will be a much smaller number than if we measure in gallons. If we measured <em class="emphasis">x</em> in liters rather than gallons (as it is measured in most countries), it would be a bigger number. So the number we calculate depends on the units we choose. To avoid these problems, we look at percentage changes and express the change as a fraction of the individual value. In what follows, we use the notation %Δ<em class="emphasis">x</em> to mean the percentage change in <em class="emphasis">x</em> and define it as follows: %Δ<em class="emphasis">x</em> = (<em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> − <em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>)/<em class="emphasis">x</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. A percentage change equal to 0.1 means that gasoline consumption increased by 10 percent. Why? Because 10 percent means 10 “per hundred,” so 10 percent = 10/100 = 0.1.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_p02">Very often in economics, we are interested in changes that take place over time. Thus we might want to compare gross domestic product (GDP) between 2012 and 2013. Suppose we know that GDP in the United States in 2012 was $14 trillion and that GDP in 2013 was $14.7 trillion. Using the letter <em class="emphasis">Y</em> to denote GDP measured in trillions, we write <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2012</sub> = 14.0 and <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2013</sub> = 14.7. If we want to talk about GDP at different points in time without specifying a particular year, we use the notation <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>. We express the change in a variable over time in the form of a growth rate, which is just an example of a percentage change. Thus the growth rate of GDP in 2013 is calculated as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">%Δ<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2013</sub> = (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2013</sub> − <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2012</sub>)/<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2012</sub> = (14.7 − 14)/14 = 0.05.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_p03">The growth rate equals 5 percent. In general, we write %Δ<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+1</sub> = (<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+1</sub> − <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>)/<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>. Occasionally, we use the <em class="emphasis">gross growth rate</em>, which simply equals 1 + the growth rate. So, for example, the gross growth rate of GDP equals <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2013</sub>/<em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2012</sub>, or 1.05.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_p04">There are some useful rules that describe the behavior of percentage changes and growth rates.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">The Product Rule.</strong> Suppose we have three variables, <em class="emphasis">x</em>, <em class="emphasis">y</em>, and <em class="emphasis">z</em>, and suppose</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_p07">In other words, the growth rate of a product of two variables equals the sum of the growth rates of the individual variables.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">More Formally</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s11_s01_p01">Growth rates compound over time: if the growth rate of a variable is constant, then the change in the variable increases over time. For example, suppose GDP in 2020 is 20.0, and it grows at 10 percent per year. Then in 2021, GDP is 22.0 (an increase of 2.0), but in 2022, GDP is 24.2 (an increase of 2.2). If this compounding takes place every instant, then we say that we have <em class="emphasis">exponential growth</em>. Formally, we write exponential growth using the number <em class="emphasis">e</em> = 2.71828.… If the value of <em class="emphasis">Y</em> at time 0 equals <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub> and if <em class="emphasis">Y</em> grows at the constant rate <em class="emphasis">g</em> (where <em class="emphasis">g</em> is an “annualized” or per year growth rate), then at time <em class="emphasis">t</em> (measured in years),</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p01">To start our presentation of descriptive statistics, we construct a data set using a spreadsheet program. The idea is to simulate the flipping of a two-sided coin. Although you might think it would be easier just to flip a coin, doing this on a spreadsheet gives you a full range of tools embedded in that program. To generate the data set, we drew 10 random numbers using the spreadsheet program. In the program we used, the function was called RAND and this generated the choice of a number between zero and one. Those choices are listed in the second column of <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s12_t01">Table 16.9</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p02">The third column creates the two events of heads and tails that we normally associate with a coin flip. To generate this last column, we adopted a rule: if the random number was less than 0.5, we termed this a “tail” and assigned a 0 to the draw; otherwise we termed it a “head” and assigned a 1 to the draw. The choice of 0.5 as the cutoff for heads reflects the fact that we are considering the flips of a fair coin in which each side has the same probability: 0.5.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p03">Keep in mind that the realization of the random number in draw <em class="emphasis">i</em> is independent of the realizations of the random numbers in both past and future draws. Whether a coin comes up heads or tails on any particular flip does not depend on other outcomes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p04">There are many ways to summarize the information contained in a sample of data. Even before you start to compute some complicated statistics, having a way to present the data is important. One possibility is a bar graph in which the fraction of observations of each outcome is easily shown. Alternatively, a pie chart is often used to display this fraction. Both the pie chart and the bar diagram are commonly found in spreadsheet programs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p05">Economists and statisticians often want to describe data in terms of numbers rather than figures. We use the data from the table to define and illustrate two statistics that are commonly used in economics discussions. The first is the mean (or average) and is a measure of <em class="emphasis">central tendency</em>. Before you read any further, ask, “What do you think the average ought to be from the coin flipping exercise?” It is natural to say 0.5, since half the time the outcome will be a head and thus have a value of zero, whereas the remainder of the time the outcome will be a tail and thus have a value of one.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p06">Whether or not that guess holds can be checked by looking at <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s12_t01">Table 16.9</a> and calculating the mean of the outcome. We let <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub> be the outcome of draw <em class="emphasis">i</em>. For example, from the table, <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> = 1 and <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript">5</sub> = 0. Then the formula for the mean if there are <em class="emphasis">N</em> draws is μ = Σ<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub><em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub>/<em class="emphasis">N.</em> Here Σ<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub><em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub> means the sum of the <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub> outcomes. In words, the mean, denoted by μ, is calculated by adding together the draws and dividing by the number of draws (<em class="emphasis">N</em>). In the table, <em class="emphasis">N</em> = 10, and the sum of the draws of random numbers is about 51.0. Thus the mean of the 10 draws is about 0.51.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p07">We can also calculate the mean of the heads/tails column, which is 0.6 since heads came up 6 times in our experiment. This calculation of the mean differs from the mean of the draws since the numbers in the two columns differ with the third column being a very discrete way to represent the information in the second column.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p08">A second commonly used statistic is a measure of dispersion of the data called the variance. The variance, denoted σ<sup class="superscript">2</sup>, is calculated as σ<sup class="superscript">2</sup> = Σ<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub>(<em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub> − μ)<sup class="superscript">2</sup>/(<em class="emphasis">N</em>). From this formula, if all the draws were the same (thus equal to the mean), then the variance would be zero. As the draws spread out from the mean (both above and below), the variance increases. Since some observations are above the mean and others below, we square the difference between a single observation (<em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">i</em></sub>) and the mean (μ) when calculating the variance. This means that values above and below the mean both contribute a positive amount to the variance. Squaring also means that values that are a long way away from the mean have a big effect on the variance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s12_p09">For the data given in the table, the mean of the 10 draws was given as μ = 0.51. So to calculate the variance, we would subtract the mean from each draw, square the difference, and then add together the squared differences. This yields a variance of 0.118 for this draw. A closely related concept is that of the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance. For our example, the standard deviation is 0.34. The standard deviation is greater than the variance since the variance is less than 1.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.13</span> Correlation and Causality</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p01">Correlation is a statistical measure describing how two variables move together. In contrast, causality (or causation) goes deeper into the relationship between two variables by looking for cause and effect.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p02">Correlation is a statistical property that summarizes the way in which two variables move either over time or across people (firms, governments, etc.). The concept of correlation is quite natural to us, as we often take note of how two variables interrelate. If you think back to high school, you probably have a sense of how your classmates did in terms of two measures of performance: grade point average (GPA) and the results on a standardized college entrance exam (SAT or ACT). It is likely that classmates with high GPAs also had high scores on the SAT or ACT exam. In this instance, we would say that the GPA and SAT/ACT scores were positively correlated: looking across your classmates, when a person’s GPA is higher than average, that person’s SAT or ACT score is likely to be higher than average as well.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p03">As another example, consider the relationship between a household’s income and its expenditures on housing. If you conducted a survey across households, it is likely that you would find that richer households spend more on most goods and services, including housing. In this case, we would conclude that income and expenditures on housing are positively correlated.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p04">When economists look at data for a whole economy, they often focus on a measure of how much is produced, which we call real gross domestic product (real GDP), and the fraction of workers without jobs, called the unemployment rate. Over long periods of time, when GDP is above average (the economy is doing well), the unemployment rate is below average. In this case, GDP and the unemployment rate are negatively correlated, as they tend to move in opposite directions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p05">The fact that one variable is correlated with another does not inform us about whether one variable <em class="emphasis">causes</em> the other. Imagine yourself on an airplane in a relaxed mood, reading or listening to music. Suddenly, the pilot comes on the public address system and requests that you buckle your seat belts. Usually, such a request is followed by turbulence. This is a correlation: the announcement by the pilot is positively correlated with air turbulence. The correlation is of course not perfect because sometimes you hit some bumps without warning, and sometimes the pilot’s announcement is not followed by turbulence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p06">But—obviously—this does not mean that we could solve the turbulence problem by turning off the public address system. The pilot’s announcement does not <em class="emphasis">cause</em> the turbulence. The turbulence is there whether the pilot announces it or not. In fact, the causality runs the other way. The turbulence causes the pilot’s announcement.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s13_p07">We noted earlier that real GDP and unemployment are negatively correlated. When real GDP is below average, as it is during a recession, the unemployment rate is typically above average. But what is the causality here? If unemployment caused recessions, we might be tempted to adopt a policy that makes unemployment illegal. For example, the government could fine firms if they lay off workers. This is not a good policy because we do not think that low unemployment causes high real GDP. Neither do we necessarily think that high real GDP causes low unemployment. Instead, based on economic theory, there are other influences that affect both real GDP and unemployment.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s14_p01">When you borrow or lend, you normally do so in dollar terms. If you take out a loan, the loan is denominated in dollars, and your promised payments are denominated in dollars. These dollar flows must be corrected for inflation to calculate the repayment in real terms. A similar point holds if you are a lender: you need to calculate the interest you earn on saving by correcting for inflation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s14_p02">The <strong class="emphasis bold">Fisher equation</strong> provides the link between nominal and real interest rates. To convert from nominal interest rates to real interest rates, we use the following formula:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">real interest rate ≈ nominal interest rate − inflation rate.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s14_p03">To find the real interest rate, we take the nominal interest rate and subtract the inflation rate. For example, if a loan has a 12 percent interest rate and the inflation rate is 8 percent, then the real return on that loan is 4 percent.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s14_p04">In calculating the real interest rate, we used the actual inflation rate. This is appropriate when you wish to understand the real interest rate actually paid under a loan contract. But at the time a loan agreement is made, the inflation rate that will occur in the future is not known with certainty. Instead, the borrower and lender use their <em class="emphasis">expectations</em> of future inflation to determine the interest rate on a loan. From that perspective, we use the following formula:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">contracted nominal interest rate ≈ real interest rate + expected inflation rate.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s14_p05">We use the term <em class="emphasis">contracted nominal interest rate</em> to make clear that this is the rate set at the time of a loan agreement, not the realized real interest rate.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.15</span> The Aggregate Production Function</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p01">The aggregate production function describes how total real gross domestic product (real GDP) in an economy depends on available inputs. Aggregate output (real GDP) depends on the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_l01">
        <li>Physical capital—machines, production facilities, and so forth that are used in production</li>
        <li>Labor—the number of hours that are worked in the entire economy</li>
        <li>Human capital—skills and education embodied in the workforce of the economy</li>
        <li>Knowledge—basic scientific knowledge, and blueprints that describe the available production processes</li>
        <li>Social infrastructure—the general business, legal and cultural environment</li>
        <li>The amount of natural resources available in an economy</li>
        <li>Anything else that we have not yet included</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p99">We group the inputs other than labor, physical, and human capital together, and call them technology.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p02">The aggregate production function has several key properties. First, output increases when there are increases in physical capital, labor, and natural resources. In other words, the marginal products of these inputs are all positive.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p03">Second, the increase in output from adding more inputs is lower when we have more of a factor. This is called diminishing marginal product. That is,</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_l02">
        <li>The more capital we have, the less additional output we obtain from additional capital.</li>
        <li>The more labor we have, the less additional output we obtain from additional labor.</li>
        <li>The more natural resources we have, the less additional output we obtain from additional resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p04">In addition, increases in output can also come from increases in human capital, knowledge, and social infrastructure. In contrast to capital and labor, we do not assume that there are diminishing returns to human capital and technology. One reason is that we do not have a natural or an obvious measure for human capital, knowledge, or social infrastructure, whereas we do for labor and capital (hours of work and hours of capital usage).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p05"><a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s15_f01">Figure 16.8</a> shows the relationship between output and capital, holding fixed the level of other inputs. This figure shows two properties of the aggregate production function. As capital input is increased, output increases as well. But the change in output obtained by increasing the capital stock is lower when the capital stock is higher: this is the diminishing marginal product of capital.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_p06">In many applications, we want to understand how the aggregate production function responds to variations in the technology or other inputs. This is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s15_f02">Figure 16.9</a>. An increase in, say, technology means that for a given level of the capital stock, more output is produced: the production function shifts upward as technology increases. Further, as technology increases, the production function is steeper: the increase in technology increases the marginal product of capital.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_s02_s01_p01">We can write the production function in mathematical form. We use <em class="emphasis">Y</em> to represent real GDP, <em class="emphasis">K</em> to represent the physical capital stock, <em class="emphasis">L</em> to represent labor, <em class="emphasis">H</em> to represent human capital, and <em class="emphasis">A</em> to represent technology (including natural resources). If we want to speak about production completely generally, then we can write <em class="emphasis">Y</em> = <em class="emphasis">F</em>(<em class="emphasis">K</em>,<em class="emphasis">L</em>,<em class="emphasis">H</em>,<em class="emphasis">A</em>). Here <em class="emphasis">F</em>() means “some function of.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s15_s02_s01_p02">A lot of the time, economists work with a production function that has a specific mathematical form, yet is still reasonably simple:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_p01">The circular flow of income describes the flows of money among the five main sectors of an economy. As individuals and firms buy and sell goods and services, money flows among the different sectors of an economy. The circular flow of income describes these flows of dollars (pesos, euros, or whatever). From a simple version of the circular flow, we learn that—as a matter of accounting—</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">gross domestic product (GDP) = income = production = spending.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_p02">This relationship lies at the heart of macroeconomic analysis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_p03">There are two sides to every transaction. Corresponding to the flows of money in the circular flow, there are flows of goods and services among these sectors. For example, the wage income received by consumers is in return for labor services that flow from households to firms. The consumption spending of households is in return for the goods and services that flow from firms to households.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_p04">A complete version of the circular flow is presented in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s16_f01">Figure 16.10</a>. (<a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch03#coopermacro-ch03">Chapter 3 "The State of the Economy"</a> contains a discussion of a simpler version of the circular flow with only two sectors: households and firms.)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_p05">The complete circular flow has five sectors: a household sector, a firm sector, a government sector, a foreign sector, and a financial sector. Different chapters of the book emphasize different pieces of the circular flow, and <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s16_f01">Figure 16.10</a> shows us how everything fits together. In the following subsections, we look at the flows into and from each sector in turn. In each case, the balance of the flows into and from each sector underlies a useful economic relationship.</p>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Firm Sector</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s01_p01"><a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s16_f01">Figure 16.10</a> includes the component of the circular flow associated with the flows into and from the firm sector of an economy. We know that the total flow of dollars from the firm sector measures the total value of production in an economy. The total flow of dollars into the firm sector equals total expenditures on GDP. We therefore know that</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">production = consumption + investment + government purchases + net exports.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s01_p02">This equation is called the <strong class="emphasis bold">national income identity</strong> and is the most fundamental relationship in the national accounts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s01_p03">By consumption we mean total consumption expenditures by households on final goods and services. Investment refers to the purchase of goods and services that, in one way or another, help to produce more output in the future. Government purchases include all purchases of goods and services by the government. Net exports, which equal exports minus imports, measure the expenditure flows associated with the rest of the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Household Sector</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s02_p01">The household sector summarizes the behavior of private individuals in their roles as consumers/savers and suppliers of labor. The balance of flows into and from this sector is the basis of the household budget constraint. Households receive income from firms, in the form of wages and in the form of dividends resulting from their ownership of firms. The income that households have available to them after all taxes have been paid to the government and all transfers received is called disposable income. Households spend some of their disposable income and save the rest. In other words,</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">disposable income = consumption + household savings.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s02_p02">This is the <strong class="emphasis bold">household budget constraint</strong>. In <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s16_f01">Figure 16.10</a>, this equation corresponds to the fact that the flows into and from the household sector must balance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Government Sector</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s03_p01">The government sector summarizes the actions of all levels of government in an economy. Governments tax their citizens, pay transfers to them, and purchase goods from the firm sector of the economy. Governments also borrow from or lend to the financial sector. The amount that the government collects in taxes need not equal the amount that it pays out for government purchases and transfers. If the government spends more than it gathers in taxes, then it must borrow from the financial markets to make up the shortfall.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s03_p02">The circular flow figure shows two flows into the government sector and two flows out. Since the flows into and from the government sector must balance, we know that</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">government purchases + transfers = tax revenues + government borrowing.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s03_p03">Government borrowing is sometimes referred to as the government budget deficit. This equation is the <strong class="emphasis bold">government budget constraint</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s03_p04">Some of the flows in the circular flow can go in either direction. When the government is running a deficit, there is a flow of dollars to the government sector from the financial markets. Alternatively, the government may run a surplus, meaning that its revenues from taxation are greater than its spending on purchases and transfers. In this case, the government is saving rather than borrowing, and there is a flow of dollars to the financial markets from the government sector.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Foreign Sector</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s04_p01">The circular flow includes a country’s dealings with the rest of the world. These flows include exports, imports, and borrowing from other countries. Exports are goods and services produced in one country and purchased by households, firms, and governments of another country. Imports are goods and services purchased by households, firms, and governments in one country but produced in another country. Net exports are exports minus imports. When net exports are positive, a country is running a trade surplus: exports exceed imports. When net exports are negative, a country is running a trade deficit: imports exceed exports. The third flow between countries is borrowing and lending. Governments, individuals, and firms in one country may borrow from or lend to another country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s04_p02">Net exports and borrowing are linked. If a country runs a trade deficit, it borrows from other countries to finance that deficit. If we look at the flows into and from the foreign sector, we see that</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">borrowing from other countries + exports = imports.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s04_p03">Subtracting exports from both sides, we obtain</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">borrowing from other countries = imports − exports = trade deficit.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s04_p04">Whenever our economy runs a trade deficit, we are borrowing from other countries. If our economy runs a trade surplus, then we are lending to other countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s04_p05">This analysis has omitted one detail. When we lend to other countries, we acquire their assets, so each year we get income from those assets. When we borrow from other countries, they acquire our assets, so we pay them income on those assets. Those income flows are added to the trade surplus/deficit to give the <em class="emphasis">current account</em> of the economy. It is the current account that must be matched by borrowing from or lending to other countries. A positive current account means that net exports plus net income flows from the rest of the world are positive. In this case, our economy is lending to the rest of the world and acquiring more assets.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Financial Sector</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">financial sector</strong> of an economy summarizes the behavior of banks and other financial institutions. The balance of flows into and from the financial sector tell us that investment is financed by national savings and borrowing from abroad. The financial sector is at the heart of the circular flow. The figure shows four flows into and from the financial sector.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_l01">
            <li>Households divide their after-tax income between consumption and savings. Thus any income that they receive today but wish to put aside for the future is sent to the financial markets. The household sector as a whole saves so, on net, there is a flow of dollars from the household sector into the financial markets.</li>
            <li>The flow of money from the financial sector into the firm sector provides the funds that are available to firms for investment purposes.</li>
            <li>The flow of dollars between the financial sector and the government sector reflects the borrowing (or lending) of governments. The flow can go in either direction. When government expenditures exceed government revenues, the government must borrow from the private sector, and there is a flow of dollars from the financial sector to the government. This is the case of a government deficit. When the government’s revenues are greater than its expenditures, by contrast, there is a government surplus and a flow of dollars into the financial sector.</li>
            <li>The flow of dollars between the financial sector and the foreign sector can also go in either direction. An economy with positive net exports is lending to other countries: there is a flow of money from an economy. An economy with negative net exports (a trade deficit) is borrowing from other countries.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p02">The <strong class="emphasis bold">national savings</strong> of the economy is the savings carried out by the private and government sectors taken together. When the government is running a deficit, some of the savings of households and firms must be used to fund that deficit, so there is less left over to finance investment. National savings is then equal to private savings minus the government deficit—that is, private savings minus government borrowing:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">national savings = private savings − government borrowing.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p03">If the government is running a surplus, then</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">national savings = private savings + government surplus.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p04">National savings is therefore the amount that an economy as a whole saves. It is equal to what is left over after we subtract consumption and government spending from GDP. To see this, notice that</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">private savings − government borrowing = income − taxes + transfers − consumption − (government purchases + transfers − taxes)</span></span>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">= income − consumption − government purchases.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p05">This is the domestic money that is available for investment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p06">If we are borrowing from other countries, there is another source of funds for investment. The flows into and from the financial sector must balance, so</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">investment = national savings + borrowing from other countries.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s16_s05_p07">Conversely, if we are lending to other countries, then our national savings is divided between investment and lending to other countries:</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.17</span> Growth Accounting</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s17_p01">Growth accounting is a tool that tells us how changes in real gross domestic product (real GDP) in an economy are due to changes in available capital, labor, human capital, and technology. Economists have shown that, under reasonably general circumstances, the change in output in an economy can be written as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">output growth rate = <em class="emphasis">a</em> × capital stock growth rate + [(1 − <em class="emphasis">a</em>) × labor hours growth rate]</span><span class="mathphrase">+ [(1 − <em class="emphasis">a</em>) × human capital growth rate] + technology growth rate.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s17_p02">In this equation, <em class="emphasis">a</em> is just a number. For example, if <em class="emphasis">a</em> = 1/3, the growth in output is as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">output growth rate = (1/3 × capital stock growth rate) + (2/3 × labor hours growth rate)</span><span class="mathphrase">+ (2/3 × human capital growth rate) + technology growth rate.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s17_p03">Growth rates can be positive or negative, so we can use this equation to analyze decreases in GDP as well as increases. This expression for the growth rate of output, by the way, is obtained by applying the rules of growth rates (discussed in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch16_s11#coopermacro-ch16_s11">Section 16.11 "Growth Rates"</a>) to the Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function (discussed in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch16_s15#coopermacro-ch16_s15">Section 16.15 "The Aggregate Production Function"</a>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s17_p04">What can we measure in this expression? We can measure the growth in output, the growth in the capital stock, and the growth in labor hours. Human capital is more difficult to measure, but we can use information on schooling, literacy rates, and so forth. We cannot, however, measure the growth rate of technology. So we use the growth accounting equation to infer the growth in technology from the things we can measure. Rearranging the growth accounting equation,</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">technology growth rate = output growth rate − (<em class="emphasis">a</em> × capital stock growth rate)</span><span class="mathphrase">− [(1 − <em class="emphasis">a</em>) × labor hours growth rate] − [(1 − <em class="emphasis">a</em>) × human capital growth rate].</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s17_p05">So if we know the number <em class="emphasis">a</em>, we are done—we can use measures of the growth in output, labor, capital stock, and human capital to solve for the technology growth rate. In fact, we do have a way of measuring <em class="emphasis">a</em>. The technical details are not important here, but a good measure of (1 − <em class="emphasis">a</em>) is simply the total payments to labor in the economy (that is, the total of wages and other compensation) as a fraction of overall GDP. For most economies, <em class="emphasis">a</em> is in the range of about 1/3 to 1/2.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_p01">The analysis in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch06#coopermacro-ch06">Chapter 6 "Global Prosperity and Global Poverty"</a> is (implicitly) based on a theory of economic growth known as the <em class="emphasis">Solow growth model.</em> Here we present two formal versions of the mathematics of the model. The first takes as its focus the capital accumulation equation and explains how the capital stock evolves in the economy. This version ignores the role of human capital and ignores the long-run growth path of the economy. The second follows the exposition of the chapter and is based around the derivation of the balanced growth path. They are, however, simply two different ways of approaching the same problem.</p>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Presentation 1</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p01">There are three components of this presentation of the model: technology, capital accumulation, and saving. The first component of the Solow growth model is the specification of technology and comes from the aggregate production function. We express output per worker (<em class="emphasis">y</em>) as a function of capital per worker (<em class="emphasis">k</em>) and technology (<em class="emphasis">A</em>). A mathematical expression of this relationship is</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">y</em> = <em class="emphasis">Af</em>(<em class="emphasis">k</em>),</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p02">where <em class="emphasis">f</em>(<em class="emphasis">k</em>) means that output per worker depends on capital per worker. As in our presentation of production functions, output increases with technology. We assume that <em class="emphasis">f</em>() has the properties that more capital leads to more output per capita at a diminishing rate. As an example, suppose</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">y</em> = <em class="emphasis">Ak</em><sup class="superscript">1/3</sup>.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p03">In this case the marginal product of capital is positive but diminishing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p04">The second component is capital accumulation. If we let <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub> be the amount of capital per capita at the start of year <em class="emphasis">t</em>, then we know that</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+1</sub> = <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>(1 − δ) + <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p05">This expression shows how the capital stock changes over time. Here δ is the rate of physical depreciation so that between year <em class="emphasis">t</em> and year <em class="emphasis">t</em> +1, δ<em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub> units of capital are lost from depreciation. But during year <em class="emphasis">t</em>, there is investment (<em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>) that yields new capital in the following year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p06">The final component of the Solow growth model is saving. In a closed economy, saving is the same as investment. Thus we link <em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub> in the accumulation equation to saving. Assume that saving per capita (<em class="emphasis">s</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>) is given by</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p07">Here <em class="emphasis">s</em> is a constant between zero and one, so only a fraction of total output is saved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p08">Using the fact that savings equals investment, along with the per capita production function, we can relate investment to the level of capital:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">i</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub> = <em class="emphasis">sAf</em>(<em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p09">We can then write the equation for the evolution of the capital stock as follows:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+1</sub> = <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>(1 − δ) + <em class="emphasis">sAf</em>(<em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p10">Once we have specified the function <em class="emphasis">f</em>(), we can follow the evolution of the capital stock over time. Generally, the path of the capital stock over time has two important properties:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Steady state.</strong> There is a particular level of the capital stock such that if the economy accumulates that amount of capital, it stays at that level of capital. We call this the steady state level of capital, denoted <em class="emphasis">k</em>*.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stability.</strong> The economy will tend toward the per capita capital stock <em class="emphasis">k</em>*.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p11">To be more specific, the steady state level of capital solves the following equation:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase"><em class="emphasis">k</em>* = <em class="emphasis">k</em>*(1 − δ) + <em class="emphasis">sAf</em>(<em class="emphasis">k</em>*).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p12">At the steady state, the amount of capital lost by depreciation is exactly offset by saving. This means that at the steady state, net investment is exactly zero. The property of stability means that if the current capital stock is below <em class="emphasis">k</em>*, the economy will accumulate capital so that <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+1</sub> &gt; <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>. And if the current capital stock is above <em class="emphasis">k</em>*, the economy will decumulate capital so that <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+1</sub> &lt; <em class="emphasis">k</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">t</em></sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s18_s01_p13">If two countries share the same technology (<em class="emphasis">A</em>) and the same production function [<em class="emphasis">f</em>(k)], then over time these two countries will eventually have the same stock of capital per worker. If there are differences in the technology or the production function, then there is no reason for the two countries to converge to the same level of capital stock per worker.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.19</span> The Aggregate Expenditure Model</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_p01">The aggregate expenditure model relates the components of spending (consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports) to the level of economic activity. In the short run, taking the price level as fixed, the level of spending predicted by the aggregate expenditure model determines the level of economic activity in an economy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_p02">An insight from the circular flow is that real gross domestic product (real GDP) measures three things: the production of firms, the income earned by households, and total spending on firms’ output. The aggregate expenditure model focuses on the relationships between production (GDP) and planned spending:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">GDP = planned spending</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">= consumption + investment + government purchases + net exports.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_p03">Planned spending depends on the level of income/production in an economy, for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_l01">
        <li>If households have higher income, they will increase their spending. (This is captured by the consumption function.)</li>
        <li>Firms are likely to decide that higher levels of production—particularly if they are expected to persist—mean that they should build up their capital stock and should thus increase their investment.</li>
        <li>Higher income means that domestic consumers are likely to spend more on imported goods. Since net exports equal exports minus imports, higher imports means lower net exports.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_p04">The negative net export link is not large enough to overcome the other positive links, so we conclude that when income increases, so also does planned expenditure. We illustrate this in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s19_f01">Figure 16.11 "Planned Spending in the Aggregate Expenditure Model"</a> where we suppose for simplicity that there is a linear relationship between spending and GDP. The equation of the line is as follows:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">spending = autonomous spending + marginal propensity to spend × real GDP.</span></span>

It represents the amount of spending that there would be in an economy if income (GDP) were zero. We expect that this will be positive for two reasons: (1) if a household finds its income is zero, it will still want to consume something, so it will either draw on its existing wealth (past savings) or borrow against future income; and (2) the government would spend money even if GDP were zero.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_p06">The slope of the line in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s19_f01">Figure 16.11 "Planned Spending in the Aggregate Expenditure Model"</a> is given by the <strong class="emphasis bold">marginal propensity to spend</strong>. For the reasons that we have just explained, we expect that this is positive: increases in income lead to increased spending. However, we expect the marginal propensity to spend to be less than one.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s19_p07">The aggregate expenditure model is based on the two equations we have just discussed. We can solve the model either graphically or using algebra. The graphical approach relies on <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s19_f02">Figure 16.12</a>. On the horizontal axis is the level of real GDP. On the vertical axis is the level of spending as well as the level of GDP. There are two lines shown. The first is the 45° line, which equates real GDP on the horizontal axis with real GDP on the vertical axis. The second line is the planned spending line. The intersection of the spending line with the 45° line gives the equilibrium level of output.</p>

Autonomous inflation refers to the inflation rate that prevails in an economy when an economy is at potential output (so the output gap is zero). Looking at the second term of the price adjustment equation, we see that when real GDP is greater than potential output, the output gap is negative, so there is upward pressure on prices in the economy. The inflation rate will exceed autonomous inflation. By contrast, when real GDP is less than potential output, the output gap is negative, so there is downward pressure on prices. The inflation rate will be below the autonomous inflation rate. The “inflation sensitivity” tells us how responsive the inflation rate is to the output gap.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s20_p05">The output gap matters because, as GDP increases relative to potential output, labor and other inputs become scarcer. Firms are likely to see rising costs and increase their prices as a consequence. Even leaving this aside—that is, even when an economy is at potential output—firms are likely to increase their prices somewhat. For example, firms may anticipate that their suppliers or their competitors are likely to increase prices in the future. A natural response is to increase prices, so autonomous inflation is positive. <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s20_f01">Figure 16.13 "Price Adjustment"</a> shows the price adjustment equation graphically.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.21</span> Consumption and Saving</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s21_p01">The consumption function is a relationship between current disposable income and current consumption. It is intended as a simple description of household behavior that captures the idea of consumption smoothing. We typically suppose the consumption function is upward-sloping but has a slope less than one. So as disposable income increases, consumption also increases but not as much. More specifically, we frequently assume that consumption is related to disposable income through the following relationship:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">consumption = autonomous consumption + marginal propensity to consume × disposable income.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s21_p02">A consumption function of this form implies that individuals divide additional income between consumption and saving.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s21_l01">
        <li>We assume autonomous consumption is positive. Households consume something even if their income is zero. If a household has accumulated a lot of wealth in the past or if a household expects its future income to be larger, autonomous consumption will be larger. It captures both the past and the future.</li>
        <li>We assume that the marginal propensity to consume is positive. The marginal propensity to consume captures the present; it tells us how changes in current income lead to changes in current consumption. Consumption increases as current income increases, and the larger the marginal propensity to consume, the more sensitive current spending is to current disposable income. The smaller the marginal propensity to consume, the stronger is the consumption-smoothing effect.</li>
        <li>We also assume that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one. This says that not all additional income is consumed. When a household receives more income, it consumes some and saves some.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s21_s01_p04">What happens to the remainder of the increase in disposable income?

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s01_p01">In any given year, money flows into the government sector, primarily from the taxes that it imposes on individuals and corporations. We call these government revenues. Money flows out in the form of outlays: government purchases of goods and services and government transfers. The circular flow of income tells us that any difference between government purchases and transfers and government revenues represents a government deficit.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s01_p03">When outflows are less than inflows, then we say a government is running a surplus. In other words, a negative government deficit is the same as a positive government surplus, and a negative government surplus is the same as a positive government deficit.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">government surplus = −government deficit.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s01_p04">When a government runs a deficit, it must borrow from the financial markets.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Intertemporal Government Budget Constraint</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p01">Tax and spending decisions at different dates are linked. Although governments can borrow or lend in a given year, a government’s total spending over time must be matched with revenues. When a government runs a deficit, it typically borrows to finance it. It borrows by issuing more government debt (government bonds).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p02">To express the intertemporal budget constraint, we introduce a measure of the deficit called the <strong class="emphasis bold">primary deficit</strong>. The primary deficit is the difference between government outlays, <em class="emphasis">excluding interest payments on the debt</em>, and government revenues. The <strong class="emphasis bold">primary surplus</strong> is minus the primary deficit and is the difference between government revenues and government outlays, excluding interest payments on the debt.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p03">The <strong class="emphasis bold">intertemporal budget constraint</strong> says that if a government has some existing debt, it must run surpluses in the future so that it can ultimately pay off that debt. Specifically, it is the requirement that</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">current debt outstanding = discounted present value of future primary surpluses.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p04">This condition means that the debt outstanding today must be offset by primary budget surpluses in the future. Because we are adding together flows in the future, we have to use the tool of discounted present value. If, for example, the current stock of debt is zero, then the intertemporal budget constraint says that the discounted present value of future primary surpluses must equal zero.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p05">The stock of debt is linked directly to the government budget deficit. As we noted earlier, when a government runs a budget deficit, it finances the deficit by issuing new debt. The deficit is a <em class="emphasis">flow</em> that is matched by a <em class="emphasis">change in the stock</em> of government debt:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">change in government debt (in given year) = deficit (in given year).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p06">The stock of debt in a given year is equal to the deficit over the previous year plus the stock of debt from the start of the previous year. If there is a government surplus, then the change in the debt is a negative number, so the debt decreases. The total government debt is simply the accumulation of all the previous years’ deficits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p07">When a government borrows, it must pay interest on its debt. These interest payments are counted as part of the deficit (they are included in transfers). If a government wants to balance the budget, then government spending must actually be less than the amount government receives in the form of net taxes (excluding interest).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p08">This presentation of the tool neglects one detail. There is another way in which a government can fund its deficit. As well as issuing government debt, it can print money. More precisely, then, every year,</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s22_s02_p09">Written this way, the equation tells us that the part of the deficit that is not financed by printing money results in an increase in the government debt.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s23_p01">The life-cycle model of consumption looks at the lifetime consumption and saving decisions of an individual. The choices made about consumption and saving depend on income earned over an individual’s entire lifetime. The model has two key components: the lifetime budget constraint and individual choice given that constraint.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s23_p02">Consider the consumption/saving decision of an individual who expects to work for a known number of years and be retired for a known number of years thereafter. Suppose his disposable income is the same in every working year, and he will also receive an annual retirement income—again the same in every year. According to the life-cycle model of consumption, the individual first calculates the discounted present value (DPV) of lifetime income:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">DPV of lifetime income = DPV of income from working + DPV of retirement income.</span></span>

<span class="title-prefix">16.24</span> Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s24_p01">The aggregate supply and aggregate demand (ASAD) model is presented here. To understand the ASAD model, we need to explain both aggregate demand and aggregate supply and then the determination of prices and output.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s24_p02">The aggregate demand curve tells us the level of expenditure in an economy for a given price level. It has a negative slope: the demand for real gross domestic product (real GDP) decreases when the price level increases. The downward sloping aggregate demand curve does <em class="emphasis">not</em> follow from the microeconomic “law of demand.” As the price level increases, all prices in an economy increase together. The substitution of expensive goods for cheap goods, which underlies the law of demand, does not occur in the aggregate economy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s24_p03">Instead, the downward sloping demand curve comes from other forces. First, as prices rise, the real value of nominal wealth falls, and this leads to a fall in household spending. Second, as prices rise today relative to future prices, households are induced to postpone consumption. Finally, a higher price level can lead to a higher interest rate through the response of monetary policy. All these factors together imply that higher prices lead to lower overall demand for real GDP.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s24_p04">Aggregate supply is equal to potential output at all prices. Potential output is determined by the available technology, physical capital, and labor force and is unaffected by the price level. Thus the aggregate supply curve is vertical. In contrast to a firm’s supply curve, as the price level increases, all prices in an economy increase. This includes the prices of inputs, such as labor, into the production process. Since no relative prices change when the price level increases, firms are not induced to change the quantity they supply. Thus aggregate supply is vertical.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s24_p05">The determination of prices and output depends on the horizon: the long run or the short run. In the long run, real GDP equals potential GDP, and real GDP also equals aggregate expenditure. This means that, in the long run, the price level must be at the point where aggregate demand and aggregate supply meet. This is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s24_f01">Figure 16.15 "Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand in the Long Run"</a>.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.25</span> The IS-LM Model</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_p01">The IS-LM model provides another way of looking at the determination of the level of short-run real gross domestic product (real GDP) in the economy. Like the aggregate expenditure model, it takes the price level as fixed. But whereas that model takes the interest rate as exogenous—specifically, a change in the interest rate results in a change in autonomous spending—the IS-LM model treats the interest rate as an endogenous variable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_p02">The basis of the IS-LM model is an analysis of the money market and an analysis of the goods market, which together determine the equilibrium levels of interest rates and output in the economy, given prices. The model finds combinations of interest rates and output (GDP) such that the money market is in equilibrium. This creates the LM curve. The model also finds combinations of interest rates and output such that the goods market is in equilibrium. This creates the IS curve. The equilibrium is the interest rate and output combination that is on both the IS and the LM curves.</p>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">LM Curve</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_p01">The LM curve represents the combinations of the interest rate and income such that money supply and money demand are equal. The demand for money comes from households, firms, and governments that use money as a means of exchange and a store of value. The law of demand holds: as the interest rate increases, the quantity of money demanded decreases because the interest rate represents an opportunity cost of holding money. When interest rates are higher, in other words, money is less effective as a store of value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_p02">Money demand increases when output rises because money also serves as a medium of exchange. When output is larger, people have more income and so want to hold more money for their transactions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_p03">The supply of money is chosen by the monetary authority and is independent of the interest rate. Thus it is drawn as a vertical line. The equilibrium in the money market is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_f01">Figure 16.17 "Money Market Equilibrium"</a>. When the money supply is chosen by the monetary authority, the interest rate is the price that brings the market into equilibrium. Sometimes, in some countries, central banks target the money supply. Alternatively, central banks may choose to target the interest rate. (This was the case we considered in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch10#coopermacro-ch10">Chapter 10 "Understanding the Fed"</a>.) <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_f01">Figure 16.17 "Money Market Equilibrium"</a> applies in either case: if the monetary authority targets the interest rate, then the money market tells us what the level of the money supply must be.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_p04">To trace out the LM curve, we look at what happens to the interest rate when the level of output in the economy changes and the supply of money is held fixed. <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_f02">Figure 16.18 "A Change in Income"</a> shows the money market equilibrium at two different levels of real GDP. At the higher level of income, money demand is shifted to the right; the interest rate increases to ensure that money demand equals money supply. Thus the LM curve is upward sloping: higher real GDP is associated with higher interest rates. At each point along the LM curve, money supply equals money demand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_p05">We have not yet been specific about whether we are talking about nominal interest rates or real interest rates. In fact, it is the nominal interest rate that represents the opportunity cost of holding money. When we draw the LM curve, however, we put the real interest rate on the axis, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_f03">Figure 16.19 "The LM Curve"</a>. The simplest way to think about this is to suppose that we are considering an economy where the inflation rate is zero. In this case, by the Fisher equation, the nominal and real interest rates are the same. In a more complete analysis, we can incorporate inflation by noting that changes in the inflation rate will shift the LM curve. Changes in the money supply also shift the LM curve.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s02_p01">The IS curve relates the level of real GDP and the real interest rate. It incorporates both the dependence of spending on the real interest rate and the fact that, in the short run, real GDP equals spending. The IS curve is shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_f02">Figure 16.18 "A Change in Income"</a>. We label the horizontal axis “real GDP” since, in the short run, real GDP is determined by aggregate spending. The IS curve is downward sloping: as the real interest rate increases, the level of spending decreases.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s02_p02">In fact, we derived the IS curve in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch10#coopermacro-ch10">Chapter 10 "Understanding the Fed"</a>. The dependence of spending on real interest rates comes partly from investment. As the real interest rate increases, spending by firms on new capital and spending by households on new housing decreases. Consumption also depends on the real interest rate: spending by households on durable goods decreases as the real interest rate increases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s02_p03">The connection between spending and real GDP comes from the aggregate expenditure model. Given a particular level of the interest rate, the aggregate expenditure model determines the level of real GDP. Now suppose the interest rate increases. This reduces those components of spending that depend on the interest rate. In the aggregate expenditure framework, this is a reduction in autonomous spending. The equilibrium level of output decreases. Thus the IS curve slopes downwards: higher interest rates are associated with lower real GDP.</p>

Note that both relationships are combinations of interest rates and output. Solving these two equations jointly determines the equilibrium. This is shown graphically in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s03_f01">Figure 16.21</a>. This just combines the LM curve from <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s01_f03">Figure 16.19 "The LM Curve"</a> and the IS curve from <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s02_f01">Figure 16.20 "The IS Curve"</a>. The crossing of these two curves is the combination of the interest rate and real GDP, denoted (<em class="emphasis">r</em>*,<em class="emphasis">Y</em>*), such that both the money market and the goods market are in equilibrium.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s04_p01">Comparative statics results for this model illustrate how changes in exogenous factors influence the equilibrium levels of interest rates and output. For this model, there are two key exogenous factors: the level of autonomous spending (excluding any spending affected by interest rates) and the real money supply. We can study how changes in these factors influence the equilibrium levels of output and interest rates both graphically and algebraically.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch16_s25_s04_p02">Variations in the level of autonomous spending will lead to a shift in the IS curve, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s04_f01">Figure 16.22 "A Shift in the IS Curve"</a>. If autonomous spending increases, then the IS curve shifts out. The output level of the economy will increase. Interest rates rise as we move along the LM curve, ensuring money market equilibrium. One source of variations in autonomous spending is fiscal policy. Autonomous spending includes government spending (G). Thus an increase in G leads to an increase in output and interest rates as shown in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch16_s25_s04_f01">Figure 16.22 "A Shift in the IS Curve"</a>.</p>
