        <h2 class="title editable block">The IMF Comes to Town</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_p01">In early 2002, a team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) flew to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Argentina had been prospering during most of the 1990s, but more recently it had begun to run into economic problems. The IMF is an organization that attempts to help countries having financial difficulties.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_p02">An IMF team consists of professionally trained economists. These teams visit many countries, such as Argentina, on a regular basis. In this chapter, we imagine that the IMF added you to this mission and asked <em class="emphasis">you</em> to report back on the state of the Argentine economy. As we proceed, we think about how you might have approached this task.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_p03">You arrive at Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini de Ezeiza Airport, which is a clean and modern airport on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. You ride into the city in a new car along modern highways lined with fancy billboards. When you get to the city center, you notice that there are luxurious shopping malls. You see high-end stores selling luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Versace, Hermes, and Christian Dior. The city seems prosperous, reminiscent of Paris or New York. Just looking around, you see immediately that you are not in one of the really poor countries of the world.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_p04">As you explore the city, though, you begin to look more closely and notice that things are not quite what they seemed at first glance. The luxury stores do not have many customers in them. Some buildings show signs of a lack of maintenance; it has been a while since they were repainted. Some stores are boarded up or bear signs saying that they are going out of business. There seem to be a lot of people who are not working or who are making a living selling goods on the street.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_p05">Reflecting on these conflicting clues to Argentina’s prosperity, you quickly realize that it is difficult to assess the health of an economy by casual observation. In addition, you have seen almost nothing of the country. Argentina covers over one million square miles; it is almost one-third of the size of the United States and has a population of nearly 40 million. The more you think about this, the harder the problem seems. Forty million people are buying things, selling things, making things, and consuming things every day. It seems an impossible task to make sense of all this activity and say anything useful about the economy as a whole. That challenge is the subject of this chapter.</p>

            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_p01">If you think about this question for a bit, you will realize that it has more than one dimension.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_l01">
                <li>First, we need <em class="emphasis">measurement</em>. We must summarize the economy in a manageable way, which is impossible unless we find some way of measuring what is going on in the economy. One of the primary tasks of economics is accounting. That leads to other questions: what should we count, and how should we count it?</li>
                <li>Data are not enough. Measurement will not take us very far unless we can combine it with some understanding of how the economy works. We need to know how to interpret the things we count. We need to know what our numbers mean. For this, we need <em class="emphasis">frameworks</em> that help us make sense of the economy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_p02">These two ideas guide our discussion in this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_p03">Think for a moment in very general terms about what happens in an economy. An economy possesses some resources. These include the time and abilities of the people who live in the economy, as well as natural resources, such as land or mineral deposits. An economy also possesses various means of changing, or transforming, one set of things into other things (see the following figure). For example, we have a process for making tea. We produce tea by taking cold water, energy, and dried leaves and transforming those inputs into a hot beverage that people like to drink. The simple act of making a cup of tea is an example of production.</p>

            <p class="para">One of the main economic activities is production: the transformation of inputs (raw materials, labor time, etc.) into output (goods and services that people value).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_p04">We are interested in measuring how much production occurs in an economy. Obviously, however, we cannot hope to count all the times that people drop a teabag into a cup, and it would not make much sense to do so. <em class="emphasis">Economic</em> activity typically involves more than production; it also includes the notion of exchange—buying and selling. If you make a cup of tea for yourself at home, we do not think of this as economic activity. If you buy a cup of tea at your local coffee shop, we <em class="emphasis">do</em> think of this as economic activity. A very rough definition of economic activity is as follows.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_p05">Economic activity is the production of goods and services for sale.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s00_s01_p06">Any definition this straightforward is bound to be too simple, and we will see that there are several subtleties in the actual measurement of economic activity, particularly since some goods and services are not actually bought and sold. Still, if you keep this idea in mind, it will help you as we progress through the basics of economic measurement in this chapter.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_p03">If we want to explain economic data, then we first have to get the measurement right, and a big part of this is ensuring that we get the accounting right. To make sure that we do, we begin by constructing simple examples. This is not because a simple example is enough to describe an economy; but because cannot hope to understand the complicated accounting unless we do the simple accounting correctly.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Pizza Economy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p01">To understand the economic health of Argentina—or any other country—we begin by looking at production in the economy. Let us imagine that Argentina produces a single good—pizza. Each pizza is sold for 10 pesos (which is about US$3.33). To be concrete, suppose that every worker in the economy works in a pizza factory in which (1) each hour worked produces 1 pizza, (2) each worker works 40 hours per week, and (3) each worker works 50 weeks per year. Suppose there are about 15 million workers in the economy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p02">We measure total economic activity by determining the <em class="emphasis">total value of the pizzas produced</em> in this economy. We obtain this by multiplying the previous numbers together. There are</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">40 pizzas per worker per week,</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p03">so there are</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">2,000 pizzas per worker per year (= 40 × 50),</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p04">which means that there are</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">30,000,000,000 pizzas per year (= 40 × 50 × 15,000,000).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p05">The value of those pizzas is</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">300,000,000,000 pesos per year (= 40 × 50 × 15,000,000 × 10).</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p06">The total value of all the production in the economy is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal gross domestic product (nominal GDP)</a><span class="glossdef">The market value of the final goods and services produced by an economy in a given period of time.</span></span>. The word <em class="emphasis">nominal</em> indicates that something is being measured in terms of money—in this case, Argentine pesos. For this economy, nominal GDP is 300 billion pesos per year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s01_p07">The economy we have just described is extremely stylized and somewhat dull from a culinary perspective. We begin with such a simple economy because it allows us to understand the basic workings of the economy without getting bogged down in a lot of details. We did, however, choose numbers that are the right order of magnitude for the Argentine economy in 2002: the total number of workers in Argentina in 2002 was about 15 million, and nominal GDP was about 300 billion pesos. In 2010, estimated GDP for Argentina was 1.4 trillion pesos, and the workforce was over 16 million.</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_p02">Nominal GDP is the market value of the final goods and services produced by an economy in a given period of time.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Market Value</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">Our example pretended that there was only a single good produced in the economy—pizza. In real economies, millions of different goods and services are produced, ranging from cars at an assembly plant to haircuts sold by a local barber. If our goal is to measure the overall output of an economy, we are faced with the problem of how to add together these goods and services. How do you add 60,000 cubic meters of natural gas, 1,000 trucks, and 2,000 head of cattle (to pick just a few examples of goods produced in Argentina)?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p02">We need a common denominator. Economists use the <em class="emphasis">market value</em> of the goods and services. This means that the common denominator is dollars in the United States, pesos in Argentina, kroner in Sweden, euros in Portugal, and so on. Nominal GDP equals total output produced in a year, valued at the actual market prices prevailing in that year. We choose market value for two reasons. One is simplicity: data on the market prices of goods and services are relatively easy to come by. The second reason is much more important. Market value tells us how much people are willing to pay for different goods and services, which gives us a measure of the relative value of different commodities. For example, if a new laptop computer costs $2,000 and a new hardcover novel costs $20, then the market is telling us that people are willing to trade off these goods at the rate of 100 novels to 1 laptop. In effect, the market is telling us that the laptop is 100 times more valuable than the novel.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_001">We take as given here that the market price—which tells us how much people are willing to spend—is a reasonable measure of the value of a good or a service. More precisely, it measures the value of the good or service “at the margin,” meaning it measures the value of having one more unit of the good or the service. Explaining why this is usually a sensible interpretation of the market price (and when it is not) is a topic covered in microeconomics courses.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p03">Let’s look at an example of the calculation. <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_t01">Table 3.1 "Calculating Nominal GDP"</a> considers a very small economy that produces three goods and services: T-shirts, music downloads, and meals. We show data for two years. To calculate GDP in 2012, we take the market value of the T-shirts ($20 × 10 = $200), the market value of the music downloads ($1 × 50 = $50), and the market value of the meals ($25 × 6 = $150). Adding these, we discover that nominal GDP is $400:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">($20 × 10) + ($1 × 50) + ($25 × 6) = $200 + $50 + $150 = $400.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p04">Doing the same operations for 2013, we find that nominal GDP is $442:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">($22 × 12) + ($0.80 × 60) + ($26 × 5) = $264 + $48 + $130 = $442.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p05">We can see that lots of things changed between the two years. The price of T-shirts and meals slightly increased, while music downloads became cheaper. Firms produced more T-shirts and music downloads but fewer meals.</p>

Nominal GDP increased substantially relative to 2012. Dig a little deeper, however, and it is harder to interpret this change. Production increased for some products and decreased for others. Some prices increased, and others decreased. Was 2013 really better than 2012? We come back to this question shortly.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p01">In <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s01_t01">Table 3.1 "Calculating Nominal GDP"</a>, we assumed that all of the goods and services purchased were purchased by their <em class="emphasis">final</em> users. That is, the T-shirts, music downloads, and meals were all purchased by households for consumption purposes. (Households are not the only group that consumes final goods and services in an economy. Firms, the government, and households in other countries can also be final consumers.) We term these final goods (T-shirts) and final services (music downloads and restaurant meals).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p02">In contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intermediate goods and services</a><span class="glossdef">Products that are used—and completely used up—in the production of other goods and services.</span></span> are products such as raw materials and energy that are used—and completely used up—in the production of other goods and services.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_002">There are two kinds of goods used in the production of other goods. Intermediate goods are completely used up as part of the production process. Capital goods—such as factories and machines—are not completely used up but live to produce another day. We discuss capital goods in more detail in <a class="xref" href="coopermacro-ch05#coopermacro-ch05">Chapter 5 "Globalization and Competitiveness"</a>.</span> We do not include intermediate goods in GDP. Think about a bottle of wine, for example. It might be bought by a consumer at a wine store, in which case it is counted in GDP. Alternatively, it might be bought by a restaurant to sell with its meals. In this case, the cost of the meal is included in GDP, and <em class="emphasis">the cost of the wine is already included in the cost of the meal</em>. The restaurant may have purchased the wine from a supplier, but that purchase is <em class="emphasis">not</em> included as part of GDP. If both the sale of wine to the restaurant and the sale of that wine to a customer of the restaurant were counted in GDP, the same bottle of wine would be counted twice.

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p03">Being intermediate is therefore not a feature of the good itself. It depends on how the good is used. Wine sold to a consumer directly is a final good; wine sold to a restaurant is an intermediate good. This fits with the idea that we want GDP to measure goods as they are valued by consumers.</p>

Thus we talk about US GDP, Argentine GDP, Indian GDP, or Uruguayan GDP. Similarly, most of the statistics that are collected refer to economic activity within a country. The term <em class="emphasis">economy</em> can be much more general, though, for it simply means a particular set of households and firms. We can speak of the world economy, the North Dakota economy, the Buenos Aires economy, or even the economy of a street of your hometown. The basic concepts are the same no matter what region we choose to discuss.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s04_p01">GDP is measured over a specified period of time. In principle, that time period could be anything—a week, a month, a quarter (three months), or a year. In the United States and many other countries, GDP is <em class="emphasis">measured</em> on a quarterly basis. However, it is typically <em class="emphasis">reported</em> on an annual basis. In other words, government statisticians might measure GDP for the first three months of 2012 and find that it was $4 trillion. That is, over that three-month period, $4 trillion worth of goods and services was produced. The number would typically be reported as “$16 trillion on an annual basis.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s04_p02">It does not make any sense to talk about US GDP at the instant the clock strikes noon on February 29, 2012. The amount of GDP produced at any instant of time is, for all intents and purposes, zero. Instead, we think of GDP as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flow</a><span class="glossdef">Any variable that has a time dimension.</span></span>. We can count the number of pizzas produced only if we specify some interval of time. Other variables can be sensibly measured even at a given instant. For example, we could—in principle at least—count the number of pizza ovens in existence at any given time. The number of pizza ovens at a point in time is an example of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stock</a><span class="glossdef">Any variable that can be measured in principle at an instant of time.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s02_s04_p03">The requirement that we count goods and services produced in a certain period means that we should also ignore the <em class="emphasis">resale</em> of goods produced in earlier periods of time. If a construction company builds a new house and sells it to you, the production of that home is counted as part of GDP. By contrast, if you buy a house that is 10 years old, the sale of that house is not counted in GDP. (However, if you employed a real estate company to find the old house for you, payment to that company would be included as part of GDP.) In the same way, if you purchase a used textbook that was produced 3 years ago, that purchase is not counted in GDP.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s03_p05">The first thing to do is to work out if 300 million pesos is a big number or a small number.

If you heard on the radio that nominal GDP was expected to grow by 300 million pesos in a 300-billion peso economy, the correct conclusion would be that nominal GDP would hardly change at all. By contrast, if the news announced a projected increase in nominal GDP of 30 billion pesos, the percentage change is 30 billion/300 billion = 0.1 = 10 percent. This is a substantial change in nominal GDP.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Measuring Real GDP</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_p01">In your bid to understand the economy of Argentina, you have seen that nominal GDP increased by one-third between 1993 and 2002. One possibility is that Argentina is producing one-third more pizzas than it was a decade ago—30 billion pizzas instead of 22.5 billion pizzas. This would be good news. Producing more pizzas is something we would normally think of as a good thing because it means that we are experiencing economic growth: there are more goods and services for people to consume.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_p02">In talking to people about the Argentine economy, however, you learn something disconcerting. They tell you that the prices of goods and services are greater this year than they were last year and much greater than they were a decade ago. You begin to wonder: perhaps Argentina is producing no more pizzas than before but instead pizzas have become one-third more expensive than they formerly were. We would typically feel very differently about this outcome. Yet another possibility is that there has been an increase in both the number of pizzas produced <em class="emphasis">and</em> the price of pizza, and the combined effect doubled nominal GDP. We need a way of distinguishing among these different possibilities.</p>
        <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Separating Nominal GDP into Price and Output</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p01">In our pizza economy, it is easy to tell the difference between an increase in production and an increase in prices. We can measure increased production by counting the number of pizzas, and we can measure increased prices by looking at the price of a pizza. We call the number of pizzas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real gross domestic product (GDP)</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of production that has been corrected for any changes in overall prices.</span></span> (the word <em class="emphasis">real</em> here indicates that we are effectively measuring in terms of goods and services rather than dollars), and we call the price of a pizza the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price level</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of average prices in the economy.</span></span> in the economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p02">Then it follows that</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">nominal GDP = price level × real GDP.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p03">In our example, the price level is 10 pesos, and real GDP is 30 billion pizzas. Multiplying these numbers together, we find that nominal GDP is indeed 300 billion pesos. Sometimes, for shorthand, we use the term <em class="emphasis">price</em> to mean the price level in a given year and the term <em class="emphasis">output</em> to mean real GDP in a given year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p04">Real GDP is the variable that most interests us because it measures the quantity of goods and services produced in an economy. We would therefore like to find a way to decompose nominal GDP into the price level and the level of real GDP in actual economies. But real economies produce lots of different goods and services, the prices of which are continually changing. In addition—unlike our fictional economy, where it makes sense to measure real GDP as the number of pizzas—there is no “natural unit” for real GDP in an actual economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p05">In fact, even in our pizza economy, there is still an arbitrariness about the units. Imagine that we cut each pizza into 10 slices. Then we could just as easily say that real GDP is 300 billion pizza slices instead of 30 billion pizzas, but that the price level—the price per slice—is 1 peso. We would still conclude that nominal GDP—the number of slices multiplied by the price per slice—was 300 billion pesos.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p06">So is it possible to say, in a real economy producing multiple goods and services, that nominal GDP is equal to the product of the price level and the level of real GDP? Does it still make sense to write</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">nominal GDP = price level × real GDP</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p07">as we did for the pizza economy? The answer, as it turns out, is yes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s01_p08">To see how this works, we begin by looking at how prices and output change from one year to another. Specifically, we divide 2013 nominal GDP by 2012 nominal GDP. This is one measure of the growth in nominal GDP from 2012 to 2013.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_003">Specifically, this measures the <em class="emphasis">gross growth rate</em> of nominal GDP. It is equal to 1 + the percentage change in nominal GDP.

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s02_p05">Nominal GDP increased by 10.5 percent between the two years, but real GDP is increased by only 6.25 percent. From this we see that not all of the increase in nominal GDP is due to increased output. Some of the increase is because prices increased between 2012 and 2013.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s02_p06">In our pizza economy, we said that nominal GDP was equal to the price per pizza multiplied by the quantity of pizza. In our example here, we have calculated something very similar. Nominal GDP equals the price level multiplied by real GDP. In the base year, the price level equals 1 (that is what it means to choose the base year), and so real GDP equals nominal GDP in that year. Because we can calculate the increase in the price level and the increase in real GDP from one year to the next, we can obtain a time series for the price level and a time series for real GDP. In each year, nominal GDP equals the price level in that year times real GDP in that year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s02_p07">There is, however, one difference between the calculation for our pizza economy and measurement in real economies. In the pizza economy, because there was a single good, we were able to measure real GDP in physical units—the number of pizzas. In real economies, there is no single good, and so we measure real GDP in base year dollars rather than as a physical quantity. The price level in, say, 2013 is not, strictly speaking, the price of real GDP in terms of 2013 dollars but rather is the price of a base year dollar in terms of 2013 dollars.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s02_p08">But this is a technical difference. From an intuitive point of view, it is simplest to think about real GDP as being a physical quantity—a number of pizzas. In this book we therefore imagine that real GDP is actually a bundle of goods and services all melded together to create a composite good. We call that good “units of real GDP,” and we call the price level the price of a unit of GDP. In fact, we could think about the pizza economy in that same way. Even a basic pizza is itself composed of dough, sauce, and cheese: it is a bundle of items melded into one. So when we talk about the physical quantity of pizza, we are really talking about the number of bundles of these ingredients. Likewise, when we talk of real GDP, we are talking about a bundle of goods that we measure in base year dollars.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s01_s04_s02_p09">Real GDP is our most basic measure of economic performance. It is a very broad measure because it tells us how much economic activity of any kind (at least, any kind that we can measure) is going on in our economy. Real GDP tells us how much we have produced of all the different goods and services that people enjoy and want to consume. For this reason, real GDP statistics are among the most closely watched of all the figures released by a government.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Consumer Price Index</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s03_p01">In this book, we use price indices that measure the general level of inflation. There are several such measures, but we do not need to worry about this. The differences among these different measures are usually small and typically unimportant for our basic understanding of the economy. The measure of inflation that we have used so far is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">GDP deflator</a><span class="glossdef">A price index that uses as the bundle of goods everything that goes into GDP.</span></span>, a price index that uses as the bundle of goods everything that goes into GDP. A more common measure of inflation is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a><span class="glossdef">A price index that uses as the bundle of goods the typical purchases of households.</span></span>, which uses as the bundle of goods the typical purchases of households.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s03_p02">The CPI is the most familiar measure of prices. When economic commentators speak of inflation, they usually mean the percentage change in the CPI. As the name suggests, the CPI is intended to measure inflation as consumers experience it. The bundle of goods included in the CPI is supposed to correspond to the bundle of goods purchased by a typical household. This means that certain goods that are included in GDP do not show up in the CPI. For example, an increase in the price of stealth bombers does not show up in the CPI because (we hope!) households do not buy stealth bombers. However, stealth bombers do show up in the GDP deflator. At the same time, certain goods that are not part of GDP are included in the CPI—most importantly, consumer goods that are imported from other countries. Because imported goods are not produced in the domestic economy, they do not show up in the GDP deflator; however, because domestic consumers purchase imported goods, they do show up in the CPI.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s03_p03">Households differ dramatically in their consumption patterns, so different households have very different experiences of inflation. An individual who drives 100 miles daily to get to work views variations in the price of gasoline very differently from someone who rides a bicycle to work. The CPI captures the average experience of all households, which can be quite different from the actual experience of an individual household.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Calculation of the CPI in Practice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s04_p01">The actual calculation of the CPI is more complicated than our example suggests. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS; <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi">http://www.bls.gov/cpi</a>) is the US government agency that is responsible for this calculation, while other countries have similar agencies. The BLS procedure is, in essence, the one we have described: it compares the cost of the same bundle of goods in different years. However, the BLS confronts several difficulties that we have ignored so far.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>
                <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Quality changes.</strong> Imagine that you now work for the BLS (you took this job after you left the International Monetary Fund [IMF]) and are asked to look at changes in the price of laptop computers. You decide to use the IBM ThinkPad computer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_007">For the history of the ThinkPad, see “ThinkPad: A Brand That Made History,” Lenovo, accessed June 28, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/ca/thinkpad/anniversary/history.html">http://www.pc.ibm.com/ca/thinkpad/anniversary/history.html</a>; for the 2011 specifications and prices, see “Lenovo Announces Premium ThinkPad Edge E220s, E420s SMB Notebooks,” ThinkPads.com, January 3, 2011, accessed July 20, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkpads.com/2011/01/03/lenovo-announces-premium-thinkpad-edge-e220s-e420s-smb-notebooks">http://www.thinkpads.com/2011/01/03/lenovo-announces-premium-thinkpad-edge-e220s-e420s-smb-notebooks</a>.</span> You discover that in 1992 a ThinkPad cost $4,300 on average. Then you find that it is possible to purchase a ThinkPad in 2011 for $899. You calculate the percentage change in the price as ($899 − $4,300)/$4,300 = −$3,401/$4,300 = −0.79 and conclude that the ThinkPad is 79 percent cheaper than two decades previously. You report this to your boss and then go home.</p>
                <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s04_p02">But then you start to worry. The 2011 ThinkPad is nothing like the 1992 version. The 1992 computer had 120 MB of memory and weighed over 5.5 pounds. The 2011 ThinkPad has 4 GB of memory and weighs 2 pounds less. It has a vastly bigger hard drive, wireless Internet connection, and a superior display. In short, there were huge quality improvements over this period. A computer with the specifications of the 1992 ThinkPad would be worth much less than $899. By ignoring the improvements in quality, you have understated how much the price of computers has fallen.</p>
                <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s04_p03">This problem is particularly acute for computers, but it applies to all sorts of different goods. The new car that you purchase today is very different from a car that your mother or your grandfather might have bought. Cars today come equipped with computerized braking systems, global positioning system (GPS) navigational tools, and numerous other sophisticated engineering features. They are also much more reliable; your grandparents will tell you that cars used to break down all the time, whereas now that is a relatively rare event. It would be a big mistake to say that a 2012 automobile is the same as a 1961 automobile.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">New goods and old goods.</strong> The typical basket of goods bought by consumers is changing. In 1970, no one had a mobile phone, an MP3 player, or a plasma television. Similarly, people today are not buying vinyl records, videocassette recorders, or Polaroid cameras. The BLS needs to keep up with every change. As the economy evolves and new goods replace old ones, they must change the basket of goods.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Changes in purchasing patterns.</strong> The bundle purchased by the typical household also changes over time because of changes in the prices of goods and services. The typical household will substitute away from expensive goods to relatively cheaper ones. If the basket of goods is held fixed, the calculation of the CPI will overstate the increase in the cost of living. This effect is most severe if there are two goods that are very close substitutes and the price of one increases significantly relative to another.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s04_p04">Perhaps these seem like minor details in the calculation of the CPI. They are not. A government commission chaired by the economist Michael Boskin provided an extensive report on biases in computing the CPI in 1996. The Boskin Commission concluded the following: “The Commission’s best estimate of the size of the upward bias looking forward is 1.1 percentage points per year. The range of plausible values is 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points per year.” That is, the Boskin Commission concluded that if inflation as measured by the CPI was, say, 3.1 percent, the true inflation rate was only 2 percent. In response to these concerns with measurement, the BLS responded by taking actions to reduce the biases in the measurement of the CPI and deal more effectively with the introduction of new goods.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_008">For the complete Boskin Commission Report, see Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index, “Toward a More Accurate Measure of the Cost of Living,” Social Security Administration, December 4, 1996, accessed June 28, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html">http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html</a>.

This gives the third column of <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s02_s05_t03">Table 3.7 "Sales Data Corrected for Inflation, 2000–2005"</a>, labeled “Price Index.” Then she divides each of the sales figures by the corresponding price index to obtain the real (that is, corrected for inflation) value of sales. These are given in the final column of the table.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s05_p06">We can see that the sales data are much less rosy after we account for inflation. Sales were increasing between 2000 and 2003 in real terms, but real sales decreased in 2004 and 2005. Had she just looked at the dollar measure of sales, she would have completely missed the fact that the business had experienced a downturn in the last two years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s05_p07">Economic statistics reported in the news or used by businesspeople are very often given in nominal rather than real terms. Perhaps the single most important piece of “economic literacy” that you can learn is that you should always correct for inflation. Likewise, you should be on your guard for misleading statistics that fail to make this correction. Here is an example from an article that appeared in the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>. “The Clinton recovery has been far less egalitarian than the much-criticized Reagan ‘era of greed.’ Between 1990 and 1995, the [real average] family income actually declined slightly while the number of people with a net worth over $1 million more than doubled.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_010">See J. Kotkin and D. Friedman, “Keep the Champagne on Ice,” <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em>, reprinted in <em class="emphasis">The Guardian Weekly</em>, June 7, 1998. In fact, the quote in the newspaper was even more misleading because it did not even make it clear that the family income figure was adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s02_s05_p08">Can you see why this sentence is so misleading? It mixes together a real measure and a nominal measure in the same sentence. Real family income—that is, family income corrected for inflation—declined in the first half of the 1990s. But the number of millionaires is a nominal measure. In a time of inflation, we would expect to have more millionaires, even if people are not really getting any richer.</p>

        <p class="para" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_p05">This relationship lies at the heart of macroeconomic analysis.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_p06">There are two sides to every transaction. When you purchase a piece of computer software, you give money to the seller, and the seller gives the software to you. (You might literally hand over dollar bills and receive a CD, or you might enter a credit card number into a website entitling you to a download. The idea is the same either way.) There is a flow of money from you to the seller and a flow of goods or services from the seller to you. This is true for all transactions: as individuals and firms buy and sell goods and services, money flows among the different sectors of the economy. Macroeconomists follow the money. By tracking these flows, we can understand the links between different markets; by understanding these links, we gain insight into the functioning of an economy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_p07">One linkage is between income and spending. The spending by households on goods and services is funded by the income that households earn. But this income comes from firms, and they get <em class="emphasis">their</em> income from the spending of households. Thus there is a circular flow of income in an economy as a whole.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_p08">Household income comes from two main sources: (1) Households contain workers who sell their time to firms and receive wages in return. (2) Households are the ultimate owners of the firms—shareholders live in houses too—and thus any profits that firms make are returned to households. All firms in an economy are owned by someone, and any profits they make do not vanish into thin air but must eventually show up as someone’s income.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_p09">Households take this income and do one of two things: they either spend it or save it. To start, let us figure out what would happen if no household income is saved. Households spend all their income, and this money becomes the revenue of firms. Firms send these revenues back to households, either as labor income or profits, and so the circular flow continues.</p>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Simplest Version of the Circular Flow</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01_p01">We can make this idea more precise, using the pizza economy to illustrate. Imagine that our economy is composed of two <em class="emphasis">sectors</em>, which we call households and firms. Households supply labor to firms and are paid wages in return. Firms use that labor to produce pizzas and sell those pizzas to households. There is a flow of goods (pizzas) from firms to households and a flow of labor services (worker hours) from households to firms. Because there are two sides to every transaction, there is also a flow of dollars from households to firms, as households purchase pizza, and a flow of dollars from firms to households, as firms pay workers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01_p02">For now, think of firms as very simple entities that pay out all the income they receive in the form of wages to workers. As a result, 300 billion pesos flow from the household sector to the firm sector (the purchase of pizzas) each year, while 300 billion pesos flow from the firm sector to the household sector (the payment of wages). These flows of pesos are illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.11 "The Simplest Version of the Circular Flow"</a>. Think of this diagram as representing the interaction of many households with many firms. A particular household works for one (or perhaps a few firms) but purchases goods and services from many firms. (If you like, imagine that different firms specialize in different kinds of pizza.) A feature of modern economies is that individuals <em class="emphasis">specialize in production</em> of goods and services but <em class="emphasis">generalize in consumption</em> by consuming many varieties of goods and services.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01_p03">The circular flow reveals that there are several different ways to measure the level of economic activity. From the household perspective, we can look at either the amount of income earned by households or their level of spending. From the firm perspective, we can look at either the level of revenues earned from sales or the amount of their payments to workers and shareholders. In all cases, the level of nominal economic activity would be measured at 300 billion pesos.</p>

In the household sector, total spending by the household equals total income for the household. If spending equals income for each individual household, then spending also equals income for the household sector as a whole. Similarly, each firm has a balance sheet. Accounting rules ensure that all of a firm’s revenues must ultimately show up on the other side of the balance sheet as payments for the inputs that the firm uses (in our simple example, the firm’s only input is labor). As this is true for each individual firm, it is also true for the sector as a whole.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Payments to inputs = income.</strong> Firms are legal entities, not people. We may talk in common speech of a firm “making money,” but any income generated by a firm must ultimately end up in the hands of real people—that is, in the household sector of an economy. The total value of the goods produced by firms becomes an outflow of dollars from the firm sector. These dollars end up in the hands of households in the form of income. (This ownership is achieved through many forms, ranging from firms that are owned and operated by individuals to giant corporations whose ownership is determined by stock holdings. Not all households own firms in this way, but in macroeconomics it is sufficient to think about the average household that does own stock in firms.)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Income = spending.</strong> We complete the circle by looking at the household sector. The dollars that flow into the household sector are the income of that sector. They must equal the dollars that flow out of the household sector—its spending.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01_p08">The circular flow of income highlights a critical fact of national income accounting:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s01_p09">Earlier, we emphasized that GDP measures the production of an economy. Now we see that GDP is equally a measure of the income of an economy. Again, this reflects the fact that there are two sides to each transaction.

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Financial Sector</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s04_p01">The financial sector of an economy is at the heart of the circular flow. It summarizes the behavior of banks and other financial institutions. Most importantly, this sector of the circular flow shows us that the savings of households provide the source of investment funds for firms. On the left-hand side, the figure shows a flow of dollars from the household sector into financial markets, representing the saving of households. (Though we have not included it in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_f01">Figure 3.14 "The Complete Circular Flow"</a>, firms also save, by means of profits that they retain to finance new investment rather than distribute to their shareholders. As far as the national accounts are concerned, it is as if firms sent these funds to the financial market and then borrowed them back again.) When we borrow from other countries, there is a second flow of dollars into the financial markets. On the right-hand side, there is a flow of money from the financial sector into the firm sector, representing the funds that are available to firms for investment purposes. The linkage between the saving of households and the investment of firms is one of the most important ideas in macroeconomics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s04_p02">The financial sector is also linked to the government sector and the foreign sector. These flows can go in either direction. As we have already seen, if the government runs a deficit, it does so by borrowing from the financial markets. There is a flow from the financial sector to the government sector. This is the case we have drawn in <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_f01">Figure 3.14 "The Complete Circular Flow"</a>. If the government were to run a surplus, the flow would go in the other direction: government would provide an additional source of saving. The foreign sector can provide an additional source of funds for investment, if those in other countries decide they want to use some of their savings to purchase assets in our economy. In this case, there is a flow from the foreign sector into the financial sector. Again, this is the case we have drawn. If we lend to other countries, then the flow goes in the other direction.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s04_p03">The flows in and out of the financial sector must balance, so</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Foreign Sector</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p01">The foreign sector is perhaps the hardest part of the circular flow to understand because we have to know how international transactions are carried out.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p02">Some of the goods produced in an economy are not consumed by domestic households or firms in an economy but are instead exported to other countries. Whenever one country sells something to another country, it acquires an asset from that country in exchange. For example, suppose a US movie company sells DVDs to an Australian distributor. The simplest way to imagine this is to suppose that the distributor hands over Australian dollar bills to the movie company. The movie company—and, more generally, the US economy—has now acquired a foreign asset—Australian dollars.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p03">Because these Australian dollars can be used to purchase Australian goods and services at some time in the future, the US economy has acquired a claim on Australia. In effect, the United States has made a loan to Australia. It has sent goods to Australia in exchange for the promise that it can claim Australian products at some future date.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p04">Similarly, some of the goods consumed in our economy are not produced locally. For example, suppose that a US restaurant chain purchases Argentine beef. These are imports. We could imagine that the restaurant chain hands over US dollars to the Argentine farmers. In this case, the United States has borrowed from Argentina. It has received goods from Argentina but has promised that it will give some goods or services to Argentina in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p05">Of course, international transactions in practice are more complicated than these simple examples. Yet the insight we have just uncovered remains true no matter how intricate the underlying financial transactions are. Exports are equivalent to a loan to the rest of the world. Imports are equivalent to borrowing from the rest of the world.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p06">If we import more than we export, then we are borrowing from the rest of the world. We can see this by looking at the flows in and out of the foreign sector:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">borrowing from abroad = imports − exports.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s02_s05_p07">If we export more than we import, then—on net—we are lending to the rest of the world, and there is a flow of dollars from the financial markets to the rest of the world.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s03_p01">We saw that, in Argentina, real GDP decreased between 1998 and 2002. The circular flow of income tells us that when real GDP decreases, it must also be the case that real production decreases and real spending decreases. The IMF team in 2002 wanted to understand <em class="emphasis">why</em> real GDP decreased. We are not going to answer that question in this chapter—after all, we are still at the very beginning of your study of macroeconomics. Still, the circular flow still teaches us something very important. If real GDP decreased, then there are really only two possibilities:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s03_l01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s03_s03_p02">Of course, it could be the case that both of these are true. This insight from the circular flow is a starting point for explaining what happened in Argentina and what happens in other countries when output decreases.</p>

            <li>When the focus is on real gross domestic product (real GDP), what aspects of economic welfare are then missed?</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_p02">As you leave Argentina, you might well find yourself wondering about the implications of your work. You know that real GDP decreased, and from your study of the circular flow, you know that income decreased as well. Argentines have become poorer, as you might have guessed from the boarded-up stores you saw when you arrived in the country. You hope that, with the help of your observations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Argentine government will together find a way to enact good policies to increase the welfare—that is, happiness—of the individuals who live and work in the economy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_p03">Our happiness is surely influenced by our material well-being—our ability to live in comfort; enjoy good food; have access to books, music, computers, and videogames; and so forth. In addition, it depends on our having the leisure time to enjoy these comforts; socialize with our friends; and go to movies, plays, and restaurants. However, our happiness depends on many other factors that are beyond the purview of economics and the influence of economic policymakers. Our happiness depends on our friends, families, health, and much more. Economics cannot help us very much with such matters. So, you wonder, is it enough to look at real GDP?</p>
    <div class="section" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Real GDP and Economic Welfare</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p01">Real GDP is certainly a useful indicator of how well an economy is performing. This does not necessarily mean that it tells us about the welfare of those who live there. Some countries, such as China or India, have a large real GDP simply because they have large populations. Living standards in these countries are nonetheless relatively low because the large GDP must be shared by a very large number of people. To correct for this, we look at real GDP <em class="emphasis">per person</em>, which measures how much GDP would be available if we shared it equally across the entire population.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p02">If two countries have substantially different levels of real GDP per person, we can fairly reliably infer that the richer country, by this measure, is also the country with higher living standards. Real GDP per person in Germany is about 25 times greater than real GDP per person in Kenya. Even a few minutes spent in the streets of Nairobi and Berlin would confirm that Germany enjoys much higher material living standards. However, when we compare countries with similar levels of real GDP per person, it is rash to assume that a richer country necessarily enjoys a higher standard of living. This is because there are several ways in which real GDP per person is flawed as an indicator of economic welfare.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p03">Remember, first, that GDP measures market transactions only. National income accounts can measure activities that are traded only in markets. If people clean their own homes, tend their own gardens, repair their own cars, or cook their own meals, these activities are not included in our measurement of GDP. (There are a few exceptions. Most notably, GDP statistics impute a value to owner-occupied housing: GDP statistics effectively pretend that homeowners rent their houses from themselves.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p04">This leads to some unfortunate inconsistencies in GDP accounting. Suppose you and your neighbor both work as auto mechanics. If you each maintain and repair your own cars, these activities do not show up in GDP. But if you hire your neighbor to maintain your car, and she hires you to repair her car, then GDP <em class="emphasis">does</em> include this economic activity. Yet another possibility is that you barter with your neighbor, so she looks after your car and you look after hers but no money changes hands. Again, this work goes unrecorded in national accounts. Barter is more prevalent in developing countries than in developed countries and causes more of a problem for measurement of GDP in poorer countries. It is a particular source of difficulty when we want to compare economic activity in different countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p05">People also value their leisure time. GDP measures the goods and services that people consume but does not tell us anything about how much time they must give up to produce those goods. For example, people in the United States are richer, on average, than people in Spain. But people in the United States work longer hours than people in Spain, and Spanish workers also enjoy much longer vacations. If we use measures of GDP to compare welfare in the United States and Spain, we will capture the fact that Americans can afford more DVD players, but we will miss the fact that they have less time to watch DVDs. GDP measures <em class="emphasis">material</em> well-being rather than <em class="emphasis">overall</em> welfare.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p06">The economic activity that goes into the production of GDP also often has negative consequences for economic welfare that go unmeasured. A leading example is pollution. Coal-generated power plants generate sulfur dioxide as a by-product of the production of electricity. When sulfur dioxide gets into the atmosphere, it leads to acid rain that damages forests and buildings. This damage is not accounted for in GDP. Emissions from automobiles contribute to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, contributing to global climate change. They also generate smog (technically, particulate matter) that is damaging to health. These adverse effects are not accounted for in GDP.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_015">There have been many attempts by economists to amend the GDP measure to take environmental issues into account. For an early discussion on this issue, see William D. Nordhaus and James Tobin, “Is Growth Obsolete?” Yale University, Cowles Foundation paper 398, accessed June 28, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf">http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p07">Critics sometimes argue that GDP not only fails to measure negative effects from production but also erroneously includes measures taken to offset those measures. This criticism is misplaced. Consider the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental damage from that spill is not included in GDP, which is indeed a problem with using GDP to measure welfare. The costs of cleaning up the gulf are included in GDP, and the inclusion of cleanup costs <em class="emphasis">does</em> make GDP a better measure of welfare. To clean up means to produce a cleaner environment from a dirty environment, which increases economic welfare. The problem is the failure to include the original environmental damage, not the inclusion of the cleanup costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p08">Finally, real GDP is an aggregate measure. It does not reflect the ways in which goods and services are distributed across the many households of an economy. In comparing two economies, we may feel differently about an economy in which resources are distributed relatively equitably compared to one in which some people are very rich and others are very poor, even if overall real GDP per person is the same. Similarly, we may feel quite differently about changes in real GDP depending on who is reaping the benefit of those changes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s01_p09">In summary, real GDP is far from a perfect measure of economic welfare, but then again it is not designed to be. It is designed to measure economic activity, and it is—at best—an imperfect measure of material well-being. Nevertheless, when we want to understand what is happening to overall economic well-being or get an idea of comparative welfare in various countries, we begin with real GDP per person. For all its flaws, it is the best single indicator that we have.</p>

The low unemployment in 1944 was largely due to World War II (and is an indication that low unemployment is not always a sign that all is well in an economy). From 1995 to 2008, the unemployment rate was never above 6 percent, but it jumped to 9.3 percent in the major recession of 2008 and by mid-2011 had still not fallen back below 9 percent.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s03_p03">In the United States, defining and measuring the unemployment rate and other labor market variables is the job of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS; <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm">http://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm</a>). Each month, about 60,000 households are asked about their recent employment experience. The BLS takes care to be sure that the sample is representative of the entire population of the United States. Notice that it is <em class="emphasis">households</em> who are interviewed, not people. So when a household is interviewed, information is acquired about all household members age 16 and over.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_017">To be more precise, in addition to being age 16 or older, the survey excludes people in an institution (such as prison) or in the armed forces.</span> As a consequence of the interview, individuals are placed in one of three categories: (1) out of the labor force, (2) in the labor force and working, and (3) in the labor force and looking for a job. Similar surveys are conducted to measure unemployment in other countries.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s03_p04">The (civilian) <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">labor force</a><span class="glossdef">All (civilian) individuals who are either working or actively looking for work.</span></span> is all individuals who are either working or actively looking for work. That is, it comprises all employed and unemployed workers. Individuals who are not in the labor force are neither employed nor looking for a job. These include those at school or choosing to stay at home. Individuals in the labor force are either employed or seeking work. Employment can be temporary or even part time; as long as someone has a job, he or she is counted as employed. Those who are not at work due to vacation, illness or family issues but who still have jobs are also counted as employed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s03_p05">The other group in the labor force is a bit more problematic: what exactly does it mean to be looking for a job? The BLS considers you unemployed if you do not have a job and have been seeking one during the past four weeks. Here, “seeking” is intended to be active (going out for job interviews), not passive (reading want ads). Individuals on temporary layoff are considered to be unemployed even if they are not actively looking for a new job. The BLS does not directly ask individuals to classify themselves into one of these three categories. Instead, BLS interviewers ask a series of questions to facilitate the classification. The sum of the civilian labor force and those out of the labor force equals the civilian working age population. <a class="xref" href="#coopermacro-ch03_s04_s03_f02">Figure 3.16 "The Unemployment Rate in Argentina"</a> shows the unemployment rate in Argentina between 1993 and 2002.

In addition, the unemployment rate increased substantially in the period when real GDP was decreasing, from 12.8 percent in 1998 to almost 20 percent in 2002.

            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s04_p01">Average real GDP figures tell us nothing about how GDP is shared in an economy. They tell us how big the pie is but not who has the largest and smallest slices. Economists therefore also look at other measures that tell us about the economic environment as it is experienced by workers and households.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s04_p02">Wages in an economy provide a sense of how workers are doing. However, the wage in dollars—the nominal wage—is not the best indicator. While salaries and pay scales for jobs are quoted in dollar terms, decisions on whether or not to take a job and how many hours to work at that job depend on what those dollars can buy in terms of goods and services. If all prices in the economy were to double, then $10 would buy only half as much as it used to, so a job paying $10 an hour would seem much less attractive than it did before.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="coopermacro-ch03_s04_s04_p03">For this reason, we instead look at the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real wage</a><span class="glossdef">The nominal wage (the wage in dollars) divided by the price level.</span></span> in the economy. As with real GDP, <em class="emphasis">real</em> here refers to the fact that we are correcting for inflation. It is real wages—not nominal wages—that tell us how an economy is doing. To convert nominal wages to real wages, we need a price index, and because we are looking at how much households can buy with their wages, we usually choose the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the index.</p>

What is going on here? Part of the story is that other forms of nonwage compensation have become increasingly significant over the past few decades. The most important of these are health-care benefits. When these and other benefits are included, we find that overall compensation has increased reasonably steadily and is about 50 percent greater now than in the early 1970s.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-coopermacro-fn03_019">More precisely, real hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector increased by 51.7 percent between 1970 and 2007.

            <li>Suppose an economy produces at least as much—and maybe more—of every good and service this year compared to last year. Also suppose that the price of every single good and service is at least as high this year as it was last year. What, if anything, can you conclude about nominal GDP, real GDP, and the price level between the two years?</li>

            <li>Suppose that Australia had nominal GDP last year equal to 1 trillion Australian dollars and that in the first quarter of this year, its nominal GDP is 252 billion Australian dollars. What is Australia’s annualized growth rate of nominal GDP?</li>
            <li>Suppose that, between 2012 and 2013, a country experiences 3 percent negative inflation (this is known as deflation). In other words, prices are on average 3 percent lower in 2013 compared to 2012. However, the economy also experiences real economic growth of 5 percent. Is nominal GDP in 2013 greater or less than in 2012?</li>
            <li>If nominal GDP in country A grows faster than nominal GDP in country B, what, if anything, can you conclude about the inflation rates in the two countries?</li>
            <li>Suppose that the price of Brazilian coffee decreases. What does that imply for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Germany? What does that imply for the GDP deflator in Japan?</li>
            <li>Is it possible for prices to be increasing and the inflation rate to be decreasing at the same time? Explain why or why not.</li>
